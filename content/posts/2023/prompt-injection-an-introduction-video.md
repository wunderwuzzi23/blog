There are many prompt engineering classes and currently pretty much all examples are vulnerable to Prompt Injections. Especially Indirect Prompt Injections are dangerous as  we [discussed](https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/ai-injections-direct-and-indirect-prompt-injection-basics/) [before](https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/ai-injections-threats-context-matters/).
 
Indirect Prompt Injections allow untrusted data to take control of the LLM (large language model) and **give an AI a new instructions, mission and objective**. 

### Bypassing Input Validation

Attack payloads are natural language. This means there are lots of creative ways an adversary can inject malicious data that bypass input filters and web application firewalls.

### Leveraging the Power of AI for Exploitation 

Depending on scenario attacks can include JSON object injections, HTML injection, Cross Site Scripting, overwriting orders of an order chat bot and even data exfiltration (and many others) all with the power of AI and LLMs.

This video aims to continue to raise awareness of this rising problem.
