In the [previous post](https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/ai-injections-direct-and-indirect-prompt-injection-basics/) we examined various prompt injections (direct, indirect, and context pollution) in AI systems, with large language models (LLMs) being particularly susceptible.

{{< figure src="/blog/images/2023/ai_injection2.jpg" width="80%" height="80%" class=".center">}}

This post will specifically focus on the output from LLMs, which is **untrusted**, and how to tackle this challenge when adopting AI systems.

## Untrusted Data from AI Models

While developing the [Yolo shell assistant](https://github.com/wunderwuzzi23/yolo-ai-cmdbot), I gained good insights and a feel for LLMs. Afterwards I built a Discord chatbot and that helped me pinpoint some real-world risks present in apps.

**When data comes back from an LLM prompt, it is considered untrusted.**

## Response Processing

This post will focus on the **untrustworthiness of LLM responses** and explore specific threats to chatbots. Understanding the context of where and when a response is inserted is crucial in understanding these issues. 

This could be a `XSS attack` if the client is a web application, or a `SQL injection attack` if the returned data is used in a SQL query. Some apps might run `OS commands` based on the LLM response - scary stuff. Nothing new here.

**BUT...**

**...there are more client side injections that you might not have thought of. Let's explore!** 

Custom **text command execution** (e.g. custom `!` commands) and things such as **data exfiltration** are vulnerabilities and threats that are applicable, especially when it comes to chatbots.

## Data Exfiltration via Hyperlink Auto-Retrieval

In the context of chatbots, data exfiltration via hyperlinks comes to mind immediately. Many chat applications **automatically** inspect URLs by default and issue a server-side (sometimes client-side) request to the link. This is the exfiltration channel.

Consider the following scenario:

[![bot.data.exfiltration.png](/blog/images/2023/bot.data.exfiltration.png)](/blog/images/2023/bot.data.exfiltration.png)

The cool (or scary) thing is that AI can also summarize the conversation history **and** append it to a hyperlink. This is the result the target server gets:

[![discord.http.link.exfil.png](/blog/images/2023/discord.http.link.exfil.png)](/blog/images/2023/discord.http.link.exfil.png)

What makes this dangerous is if anywhere in the conversation there is an **indirect prompt injection** happening, where data/instructions are pulled in from an untrusted source.

**What else?**

## Threats from LLM Reponses to Chatbots

For instance, if you build a chatbot, consider the following injection threats:
* LLM **tags and mentions of other users**, such as `@all`, `@everyone`,...
* **Data exfiltration via Hyperlinks!** Many chat apps automatically retrieve hyperlinks. This can lead to data exfiltration, if a carefully crafted responses with an attacker controller hyperlink comes back from a LLM. [See examples for a variety of chat applications in the appendix](#appendix)
* During an injection attack **AI can be leveraged to perform operations chat history and summarize or search for passwords** and so forth, then append to hyperlink.
* LLM returns **application specific commands**, e.g. something like `!command`, etc. Does this lead to invocation of commands? Send messages? This depends on the chat platform and bot implementation. [Explicit usage of things such as `/` and user interactions should mitigate this](https://discord.com/blog/slash-commands-permissions-discord-apps-bots). Review your bot for such commands.
* Other features the client supports (or parsing stack) that might be invoked by the response?

As long as the chat isn't containing attacker controlled data (e.g via Internet searches or other data retrieval, or copy/paste) the impact is probably limited (still need to think more about self-injections). 

**Injections are painful, mitigate them upfront and don't allow attackers to exploit them.**

## Mitigations

* **Threat Modeling and Manual Pentesting:** Doing pentests on AI apps can uncover injection issues.
* **Test Automation and Fuzzing:** A good approach can be to build stub for function calls to, e.g. OpenAI's `ChatCompletion` API and then start fuzzing the client and bombard it with random responses to see how it behaves. This might help catch some output injection issues and vulnerabilities. 
* **Supervisor:** A possible solution could be a "supervisor" or "moderator" that watches a conversation to make sure it doesn't derail, but that's also not perfect, as it suffers from the same problems.
* **Human in the Loop:** For risky apps and scenarios, always consider human review. For instance, with [yolo](https://github.com/wunderwuzzi23/yolo-ai-cmdbot), the default mode is that commands are not automatically executed in the shell. The user is required to review the commands, and run/copy them if they want to.
* **Permissions:** Least privilege. Make sure to not process custom text as commands with chatbots. Do not give unnecessary permissions to the bot.

## Conclusion

Remember that integration context matters.

**Go-Do:**
Threat model and test AI model integrations carefully. Identify input and output injection and elevation opportunities to raise issues and help mitigate them. Data exfiltration and context specific command execution is a real threat, especially if you insert untrusted content into your LLM prompts and blindly trust the response.

For risky apps and use cases, always consider human review. 

**Update:** I wrote up some specific mitigation guidance for Slack unfurling [here](/blog/posts/2024/the-dangers-of-unfurling-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/).

Cheers.
