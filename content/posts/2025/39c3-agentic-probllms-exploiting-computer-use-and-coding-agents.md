It was great to attend the `39C3 - Power Cycles` in Hamburg this year. The Chaos Communication Congress was once again packed with great talks, amazing people, awesome events and side quests - and I even got to present!

You can watch the talk with translation options on [media.ccc.de](https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-agentic-probllms-exploiting-ai-computer-use-and-coding-agents).

I also uploaded the English version to the Embrace The Red YouTube channel. I hope it's interesting and helpful.

The talk is titled "Agentic ProbLLMs: Exploiting AI Computer-Use and Coding Agents" and is about my security research on vulnerabilities in agentic systems and the [Month of AI Bugs](https://monthofaibugs.com) with lots of demos.

A PDF version of the slides is [here](/blog/downloads/Agentic-ProbLLMs-39c3-December-2025.pdf).

Looking forward to the next Chaos Communication Congress. 

Safe travels back home and Happy Hacking, everyone!

Johann.
