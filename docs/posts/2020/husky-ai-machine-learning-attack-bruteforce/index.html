    <p>This post is part of a series about machine learning and artificial intelligence. Click on the blog tag &ldquo;huskyai&rdquo; to see related posts.</p>
<p>The <a href="/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-walkthrough/">previous four posts</a> explained the architecture and how Husky AI was built, threat modeled and deployed. Now it’s time to start the attacks and build mitigations. The <a href="#appendix">appendix</a> in this post shows all the attacks I want to research and perform in this series over the next few weeks/months.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into the attacks.</p>
<h2 id="brute-forcing-images-to-find-incorrect-predictions">Brute forcing images to find incorrect predictions</h2>
<p>The first attack I investigated is also referred to as <strong>perturbation attack</strong> throughout the literature I have been reading. It is like fuzzing (dumb or smart) to come up with malicious input that tricks a model. It is probably the first attack that one would think of when faced to hack AI/ML - besides attacking the machine learning infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-we-testing">What are we testing?</h3>
<p>The target is Husky AI, which we have discussed in the previous posts. The operationalized Husky AI model is accessible over an HTTP endpoint. It&rsquo;s basically an image upload API, and it returns the prediction score.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/images/2020/husky-prediction.jpg"><img src="/blog/images/2020/husky-prediction.jpg" alt="Husky Prediction Example"></a></p>
<p>If you are curious the code for the simple web server is located <a href="https://github.com/wunderwuzzi23/ai/blob/master/huskyai/huskyai.py">here</a>.</p>
<p>To interact with the API I&rsquo;m using the following code:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>ENDPOINT = &#34;https://example.org/huskyai&#34;

def predict(np_candidate):

    #convert numpy array to Image in memory
    img = Image.fromarray((np_candidate*255.).astype(&#39;uint8&#39;), &#39;RGB&#39;)
    image_bytes = io.BytesIO()
    img.save(image_bytes, format=&#34;png&#34;)
    image_bytes = image_bytes.getvalue()

    #call prediction HTTPS API
    file = {
        &#34;file&#34;: image_bytes,
        &#34;Content-Type&#34;: &#34;image/png&#34;
    }

    response = requests.post(ENDPOINT, files=file)
    return response.json()
</code></pre><h3 id="what-is-happening-here">What is happening here?</h3>
<ol>
<li>The <code>predict</code> function takes a <code>numpy</code> array (a typical python data structure) and converts it to an <code>Image</code>.</li>
<li>The input array comes in with values from <code>0-1</code>. Hence, we multiply all input values by <code>255</code> and convert to a <code>uint8</code> to ensure the random pixels all have values between 0 and 255.</li>
<li>Afterwards the image is converted to <code>png</code>, and the resulting <code>image_bytes</code> are added to the <code>POST</code> request.</li>
<li>If all goes well, the web service returns a <code>JSON</code> response with the prediction as a <code>float</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is all that is needed to invoke the HTTP API from Python.</p>
<h3 id="jupyter-notebook">Jupyter Notebook</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using a Jupyter Notebook to run these attacks. Over the last couple of weeks, I really started liking the VS Code Python extension.</p>
<p>The validation accuracy of the model was in the mid 80% range and querying the API works well with the Jupyter notebook.</p>
<p>Here are two examples of calls to the API:</p>
<ol>
<li>A picture I took at a dog park identifies this dog as a husky:
<a href="/blog/images/2020/result-huskyai.jpg"><img src="/blog/images/2020/result-huskyai.jpg" alt="Husky Prediction"></a></li>
<li>The Shadowbunny scores low, not being classified as a husky:
<a href="/blog/images/2020/nonhusky-prediction-result.jpg"><img src="/blog/images/2020/nonhusky-prediction-result.jpg" alt="Non Husky Prediction"></a></li>
</ol>
<p>Equipped with a model that works decently well (or not, as we will see soon), it’s time to create images to challenge the model.</p>
<h2 id="simple-test-cases">Simple test cases</h2>
<p>When testing software to find bugs, a good strategy is testing boundary scenarios. Hence, I thought of doing the same in this case. With machine learning there are special tools and techniques available, such as adversarial learning models, Cleverhans and others which I want to research and look at later.</p>
<p>The three test cases that seemed interesting initially were <strong>all 0</strong>, <strong>all 1</strong> and images with <strong>random pixels</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is the code snippet I used to create these test images and run them through the prediction web endpoint:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>candidate_rand  = np.random.random([1, NUM_PX, NUM_PX, 3])
candidate_zeros = np.zeros([1, NUM_PX, NUM_PX, 3])
candidate_ones  = np.ones([1, NUM_PX, NUM_PX, 3])

print(&#34;Random Canvas: &#34; + str(predict(candidate_rand)))
print(&#34;Ones Canvas:   &#34; + str(predict(candidate_ones)))
print(&#34;Zeros Canvas:  &#34; + str(predict(candidate_zeros)))
</code></pre><p>Let us analyze the results in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="test-case-1-a-black-canvas"><strong>Test Case 1:</strong> A black canvas</h3>
<p>The first image I created was a <code>numpy</code> array with all 0 - which is basically a blank black canvas.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/images/2020/adversarial-image1.jpg"><img src="/blog/images/2020/adversarial-image1.jpg" alt="Husky Adversarial Image 1"></a></p>
<p>Yep, the result looks like expected.</p>
<h3 id="test-case-2-a-white-canvas"><strong>Test case 2:</strong> A white canvas</h3>
<p>The second test case was an all-white canvas:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/images/2020/adversarial-image2.jpg"><img src="/blog/images/2020/adversarial-image2.jpg" alt="Husky Adversarial Image 2"></a></p>
<p>Oh, wow! There is the first successful attack already. Looks like the model has some issues!</p>
<h3 id="test-case-25-solid-colors-from-0-255"><strong>Test case 2.5:</strong> Solid colors from 0-255</h3>
<p>Since the corner cases gave such drastic results, I went ahead to try the solid shades from 0-255 for all pixels. The results show that there is a range of 30-40 adversarial images that are huskies. So interesting.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/images/2020/adversarial-husky-grade.jpg"><img src="/blog/images/2020/adversarial-husky-grade.jpg" alt="Husky Adversarial Image - Shades"></a></p>
<p>There is still one more experiment to perform amongst these simple scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="test-case-3-images-with-random-pixels"><strong>Test case 3:</strong> Images with random pixels</h3>
<p>It was quite unexpected that the pervious scenarios already broke the model.</p>
<p>My initial plan was to create many random images in a loop until I get one that scores over 50%. However, this was not really needed. Also, for random images many are identified as husky. Look:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/images/2020/adversarial-image3.jpg"><img src="/blog/images/2020/adversarial-image3.jpg" alt="Husky Adversarial Image 3"></a></p>
<p>Quite surprising - did not assume that breaking this model would be that easy&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="take-away-from-the-attacks">Take-away from the attacks</h2>
<p>The initial learning for me here is that having basic &ldquo;unit&rdquo; tests for models is a good idea.
It will be exciting to try more advanced attacks (includ ML based ones) after fixing these issues first.</p>
<h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h2>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s discuss how to mitigate these issues, I had a couple of ad-hoc ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Simple adversarial training:</strong> My first thought is to make sure to add these test cases when training the model. This is called &ldquo;adversarial training&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Throttle calls to the web server:</strong> Not all attacks are feasible if users are throttled when submitting images. Throttling will make successful attacks more difficult for some attackers. As red teamer I&rsquo;d say its best to assume a motivated adversary has access to the model.</li>
<li><strong>Interpret predictions slightly different:</strong> We could say an image is a husky when the prediction is 60%+</li>
<li><strong>Improving the model in general:</strong> The model&rsquo;s accuracy is in the mid 80% and a bit overfitted, so there is plenty of room for improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Transfer Learning</strong> A good improvement accuracy wise will be to use &ldquo;Transfer Learning&rdquo; and build on top of the shoulders of a more mature model.</li>
</ol>
<p>The results so far are quite interesting for my learning experience. So, I want to continue that route for now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look how I trained the model for these adversarial images:</p>
<h3 id="adversarial-training">Adversarial training</h3>
<p>The simple mitigation seems to be to train the model on these corner cases and teach the model that such images are not huskies.</p>
<p>This can be done using code like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>labels = [0,0,0]
images = [candidate_rand[0], candidate_zeros[0], candidate_ones[0]]

print(&#34;Fitting model...&#34;)
model.fit(np.array(images),np.array(labels), epochs=1, verbose=0)

print(&#34;Random Canvas: &#34; + str(model.predict(candidate_rand)))
print(&#34;Zeros Canvas:  &#34; + str(model.predict(candidate_zeros)))
print(&#34;Ones Canvas:   &#34; + str(model.predict(candidate_ones)))
</code></pre><p>Since I am experimenting to learn, I only trained for a single epoch initially, here are the results:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Fitting model...

Random Canvas: [[0.25112703]]
Zeros Canvas:  [[7.170946e-05]]
Ones Canvas:   [[0.5275204]]
</code></pre><p>These number are still bad, so I trained for more epochs. Overfitting did not seem too much of a concern as these images are far off real huskies. I think it would further improve the model to cycle the random pixels for each epoch even.</p>
<h4 id="testing-the-mitigation-brute-forcing-images">Testing the mitigation (brute forcing images)</h4>
<p>To check I built this basic brute force script, which just creates a random pixel image and then runs it through the new model. <em>This test was done directly against the model, not via the slower HTTPS image upload API.</em></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>## Brute force experiment
## Is it now feasible now to guess a random husky via brute force?
attempts = 100000
current_best_score = 1e-100

for i in range(attempts):

    if (i % 10000) == 0:
        print(f&#34;Progress... #{i}&#34;)
    
    ##create a random image
    candidate_image = np.random.random([1, NUM_PX, NUM_PX, 3])
    
    result = model.predict(candidate_image)
    score = result[0]

    if score &gt; 0.5:
        print(&#34;Found a random husky. Try #&#34; + str(i))
        plt.imshow(candidate_image[0])
        break

    if score &gt; current_best_score: 
        current_best_score = score
        print(&#34;New best score: &#34; + str(current_best_score))
</code></pre><p>With the additional training we performed, it seems quite difficult to &ldquo;guess&rdquo; a husky picture now.</p>
<p>I performed about 100000 tests and the highest score achieved via random pixels was about 30% now - still a bit high so I should probably add a few more &ldquo;random pixel&rdquo; adversarial examples.</p>
<h3 id="api-throttling-and-rate-limiting">API throttling and rate limiting</h3>
<p>Throttling the web server image upload API (which queries the model) is another good mitigation. I am using <code>nginx</code> as API gateway and <code>rate limiting</code> can be setup in the configuration file of the web site. <a href="https://www.nginx.com/blog/rate-limiting-nginx/">See more information on the nginx documentation for rate limiting</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for the first round of attacks. I hope you enjoyed reading and learning about this as much as I do. I learned a lot already and am eager to dive learning smarter ways of coming up with malicious/adversarial examples.</p>
<h3 id="appendix">Appendix</h3>
<p>These are the core ML threats for Husky AI that were identified in the <a href="/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-threat-modeling-machine-learning/">threat modeling session</a> so far and that I want to research and build attacks for.</p>
