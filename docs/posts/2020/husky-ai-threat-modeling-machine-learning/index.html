    <p>This post is part of a series about machine learning and artificial intelligence. Click on the blog tag <a href="/blog/tags/huskyai/">&ldquo;huskyai&rdquo;</a> to see all the posts, or visit the <a href="/blog/posts/2020/machine-learning-attack-series-overview/">machine learning attack series overview section</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-building-the-machine-learning-model/">previous post</a> we walked through the steps required to gather training data, build and test a model to build &ldquo;Husky AI&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This post is all about threat modeling the system to identify scenarios for attacks which we will perform in the upcoming posts.</p>
<h1 id="part4">Part 4 - Threat Modeling an AI system</h1>
<p>There are quite a lot of moving pieces already in the &ldquo;Husky AI&rdquo; system that we built out.</p>
<p>To get started with identifiying security issues in a systematic way, I typically create a high-level Threat Model diagram using Microsoft Threat Modeling tool (or just on a piece of paper at times too).</p>
<p>The following is a picture the &ldquo;Husky AI&rdquo; threat model:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/images/2020/husky-ai-machine-learning-threat-model.png"><img src="/blog/images/2020/husky-ai-machine-learning-threat-model.png" alt="Husky AI Threat Model"></a></p>
<p>There is a lot to unpack, but if you read the previous posts around building and operationalizing a machine learning model the assets and their connections should make sense.</p>
<p>The threat modeling tool automatically proposes threats and it is quite thorough. It is actually common that engineers complain that the tool creates too much noise, and it takes too long to review. For instance, this threat model led to 96 threats initially that were automatically identified by the tool.</p>
<p>By clicking on a component in the threat modeling tool, we can view the specific threats for that particular asset. For example, this is the view for the web server:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/images/2020/threatmodelingtool.jpg"><img src="/blog/images/2020/threatmodelingtool.jpg" alt="Threat Modeling Tool Example"></a></p>
<p>Even though there is a large amount of threats, it is great because it highlights issues you might not think about, or not think about each time you perform threat modeling. However, it can be a bit of an overload, and threats are repetitive. There is really no requirement to use the tool - it&rsquo;s just there to help.</p>
<p>When it comes to brainstorming and classifying threats, I use STRIDE. STRIDE is a threat classification technique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security)">developed by Microsoft</a>. It puts threats into the following categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>S</strong>poofing</li>
<li><strong>T</strong>ampering</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>epudiation</li>
<li><strong>I</strong>nformation disclosure</li>
<li><strong>D</strong>enial of service</li>
<li><strong>E</strong>levation of privilege</li>
</ol>
<p>It is good approach to hold threat modeling sessions with engineers, those can be informal whiteboard sessions. Try to have at at least one threat in each category for every asset.</p>
<p><strong>It is not uncommon to forget about repudiation issues</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Repudiation</strong> is the issue of someone denying that they performed a certain action. How can you proof or disproof someone indeed updated a machine learning model in production for instance?</p>
<h3 id="perturbation-attacks">Perturbation Attacks</h3>
<p>When it comes to machine learning specific attacks most of them can be easily mapped to STRIDE categories. The one I had issues with are attacks that &ldquo;query the model&rdquo;, so called <strong>perturbation attacks</strong>. For the purpose of the threat model, I decided that this is a &ldquo;spoofing&rdquo; issue. An adversary tries to trick the algorithm to misclassify an image.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s review the core assets of the Husky AI system, and brainstorm about attacks and mitigations.</p>
<h1 id="core-assets-and-threats">Core Assets and Threats</h1>
<p>The following section lists the core assets and threats that were identified during threat modeling. This information is ideally persistent in a bug tracking system, something like Jira.</p>
<p>Threats and mitigations are a moving target, something that was considered mitigated yesterday might not be mitigated anymore today. This is also were red teaming comes into the picture to help with the realization that every system has vulnerabilities that can be exploited - there is no such thing is a 100% mitigation.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look through the main assets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training, Validation Images</li>
<li>Public facing HTTP APIs</li>
<li>Stored Machine Learning Model</li>
<li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
<li>Bing API Key</li>
<li>SSH Access and Keys</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep the flow of the post, let&rsquo;s filter them to the most interesting ones from machine learning point of view.</p>
<p>The full list of threats can be seen in the <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>. For anything I want to test, I added a <strong>&ldquo;red team opportunity&rdquo;</strong> note.</p>
<h2 id="identified-machine-learning-threats">Identified machine learning threats</h2>
<p>The following is the list of threats that I want to build attacks for:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-machine-learning-attack-bruteforce/">Attacker brute forces images to find incorrect predictions/labels</a> - Perturbation Attack</li>
<li><a href="/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-machine-learning-attack-smart-fuzz/">Attacker applies smart ML fuzzing to find incorrect predictions - Perturbation Attack</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-machine-learning-attack-perturbation-external/">Attacker performs perturbations to misclassify existing images</a> - Perturbation Attack (added)</li>
<li><a href="/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-machine-learning-model-stealing/">Attacker gains read access to the model - Exfiltration Attack</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-machine-learning-backdoor-model/">Attacker modifies persisted model file - Backdooring Attack</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-repudiation-threat-deny-action-machine-learning/">Attacker denies modifying the model file - Repudiation Attack</a></li>
<li>Attacker poisons the supply chain of third-party libraries</li>
<li>Attacker tampers with images on disk to impact training performance</li>
<li><a href="/blog/posts/2020/cve-2020-16977-vscode-microsoft-python-extension-remote-code-execution/">Attacker modifies Jupyter Notebook file to insert a backdoor (key logger or data stealer)</a></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: Those marked as added were posts added to cover some content more in-depth</em></p>
<p>This is a fairly good list with some interesting attack scenarios that we can research and perform.</p>
<p>There are other ML specific attacks such as model inversion, membership inference which I might explore at a later point, possibly when upgrading Husky AI to provide a more complex categorical model.</p>
<p>For more information on machine learning threats see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/engineering/failure-modes-in-machine-learning">Failure modes in machine learning</a> by Microsoft, as well as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07658.pdf">Hacking Neural Networks - A short introduction</a> by Michael Kissner.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>In the next post, we will do hands-on attacks against the exposed prediction API via different brute force approaches.</p>
<p>Now it will become interesting!</p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>
<p>This appendix contains the most significant threats identified and more insights. When doing this you want to store this information in an issue/bug tracking system such as Jira. This helps to track and also review dispositions in the future.</p>
