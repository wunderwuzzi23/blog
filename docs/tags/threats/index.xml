      <description>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol definition for how LLM apps/agents can leverage external tools. I have been calling it Model Control Protocol at times, because due to prompt injection, MCP tool servers control the client basically.&#xA;This post will explain in detail why that is, and I will also share a novel exploit chain.&#xA;Why MCP - How Is It Different? The main difference to other tool invocation setups, like OpenAPI is that MCP is dynamic.</description>

      <description>GitHub Copilot has the capability to be augmented with custom instructions coming from the current repo, via the .github/copilot-instructions.md file.&#xA;Pillar Security recently highlighted the risks associated with rules files. Their post discusses custom Cursor rules in ./cursor/rules ending in .mdc.&#xA;If you watch the demos, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that they also have a GitHub Copilot demo which uses the GitHub specific copilot-instructions.md file.&#xA;Update: May 1, 2025 GitHub made a product change and is now highlighting invisible Unicode characters in the Web UI.</description>

      <description>You are likely aware of ASCII Smuggling via Unicode Tags. It is unique and fascinating because many LLMs inherently interpret these as instructions when delivered as hidden prompt injection, and LLMs can also emit them. Then, a few weeks ago, a post on Hacker News demonstrated how Variant Selectors can be used to smuggle data.&#xA;This inspired me to take this further and build Sneaky Bits, where we can encode any Unicode character (or sequence of bytes for that matter) with the usage of only two invisible characters.</description>

      <description>ChatGPT Operator is a research preview agent from OpenAI that lets ChatGPT use a web browser. It uses vision and reasoning abilities to complete tasks like researching topics, booking travel, ordering groceries, or as this post will show, steal your data!&#xA;Currently, it&amp;rsquo;s only available for ChatGPT Pro users. I decided to invest $200 for one month to try it out.&#xA;Risks and Threats OpenAI highlights three risk categories in their Operator System Card:</description>

      <description>At Black Hat Europe I did a fun presentation titled SpAIware and More: Advanced Prompt Injection Exploits. Without diving into the details of the entire talk, the key point I was making is that prompt injection can impact all aspects of the CIA security triad.&#xA;However, there is one part that I want to highlight explicitly:&#xA;A Command and Control system (C2) that uses prompt injection to remote control ChatGPT instances.</description>

      <description>I regularly look at how the system prompts of chatbots change over time. Updates frequently highlight new features being added, design changes that occur and potential areas that might benefit from more security scrutiny.&#xA;A few months back I noticed an interesting update to the M365 Copilot (BizChat) system prompt. In particular, there used to be one enterprise_search tool in the past. You might remember that tool was used during the Copirate ASCII Smuggling exploit to search for MFA codes in the user&amp;rsquo;s inbox.</description>

      <description>Last week Leon Derczynski described how LLMs can output ANSI escape codes. These codes, also known as control characters, are interpreted by terminal emulators and modify behavior.&#xA;This discovery resonates with areas I had been exploring, so I took some time to apply, and build upon, these newly uncovered insights.&#xA;ANSI Terminal Emulator Escape Codes Here is a simple example that shows how to render blinking, colorful text using control characters.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, Anthropic released Claude Computer Use, which is a model + code that allows Claude to control a computer. It takes screenshots to make decisions, can run bash commands and so forth.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s cool, but obviously very dangerous because of prompt injection. Claude Computer Use enables AI to run commands on machines autonomously, posing severe risks if exploited via prompt injection.&#xA;Disclaimer So, first a disclaimer: Claude Computer Use is a Beta Feature and what you are going to see is a fundamental design problem in state-of-the-art LLM-powered Applications and Agents.</description>

      <description>This post explains an attack chain for the ChatGPT macOS application. Through prompt injection from untrusted data, attackers could insert long-term persistent spyware into ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s memory. This led to continuous data exfiltration of any information the user typed or responses received by ChatGPT, including any future chat sessions.&#xA;OpenAI released a fix for the macOS app last week. Ensure your app is updated to the latest version.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at this spAIware in detail.</description>

      <description>This post describes vulnerability in Microsoft 365 Copilot that allowed the theft of a user&amp;rsquo;s emails and other personal information. This vulnerability warrants a deep dive, because it combines a variety of novel attack techniques that are not even two years old.&#xA;I initially disclosed parts of this exploit to Microsoft in January, and then the full exploit chain in February 2024. A few days ago I got the okay from MSRC to disclose this report.</description>

      <description>Recently, I found what appeared to be a regression or bypass that again allowed data exfiltration via image rendering during prompt injection. See the previous post here for reference.&#xA;Data Exfiltration via Rendering HTML Image Tags During re-testing, I had sporadic success with markdown rendering tricks, but eventually, I was able to drastically simplify the exploit by asking directly for an HTML image tag.&#xA;This behavior might actually have existed all along, as Google AI Studio hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet implemented any kind of Content Security Policy to prevent communication with arbitrary domains using images.</description>

      <description>Google Colab AI, now just called Gemini in Colab, was vulnerable to data leakage via image rendering.&#xA;This is an older bug report, dating back to November 29, 2023. However, recent events prompted me to write this up:&#xA;Google did not reward this finding, and Colab now automatically puts Notebook content (untrusted data) into the prompt. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore the specifics.&#xA;Google Colab AI - Revealing the System Prompt At the end of November last year, I noticed that there was a &amp;ldquo;Colab AI&amp;rdquo; feature, which integrated an LLM to chat with and write code.</description>

      <description>Your Code Interpreter sandbox, also known as Advanced Data Analysis sessions, are shared between private and public GPTs. Yes, your actual compute container and its storage is shared. Each user gets their own isolated container, but if a user uses multiple GPTs and stores files in Code Interpreter all GPTs can access (and also overwrite) each others files.&#xA;This is true also for files uploaded/created with private GPTs and ChatGPT itself.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago Amazon released the Preview of Amazon Q for Business, and after looking at it I found a data exfiltration angle via rendering markdown/hyperlinks and reported it to Amazon.&#xA;Amazon reacted quickly and mitigated the problem. This post shares further details and how it was fixed.&#xA;The Problem An Indirect Prompt Injection attack can cause the LLM to return markdown tags. This allows an adversary who&amp;rsquo;s data makes it into the chat context (e.</description>

      <description>A few days ago Riley Goodside posted about an interesting discovery on how an LLM prompt injection can happen via invisible instructions in pasted text. This works by using a special set of Unicode code points from the Tags Unicode Block.&#xA;The proof-of-concept showed how a simple text contained invisible instructions that caused ChatGPT to invoke DALL-E to create an image.&#xA;Hidden Instructions for LLMs The meaning of these &amp;ldquo;Tags&amp;rdquo; seems to have gone through quite some churn, from language tags to eventually being repurposed for some emojis.</description>

      <description>Five years ago I gave a Lightning Talk at the 35th Chaos Communication Congress called &amp;ldquo;Pass the Cookie and Pivot to the Clouds&amp;rdquo;. It was a talk about my very first blog post on Embrace The Red just a few weeks earlier in December 2018.&#xA;Fast forward to 2023&amp;hellip; it was great to attend the 37C3 in person in Hamburg this year. The Congress was packed with great talks, amazing people, awesome events and side quests and I got to present also!</description>

      <description>Recently Google Bard got some powerful updates, including Extensions. Extensions allow Bard to access YouTube, search for flights and hotels, and also to access a user&amp;rsquo;s personal documents and emails.&#xA;So, Bard can now access and analyze your Drive, Docs and Gmail!&#xA;This means that it analyzes untrusted data and will be susceptible to Indirect Prompt Injection.&#xA;I was able to quickly validate that Prompt Injection works by pointing Bard to some older YouTube videos I had put up and ask it to summarize, and I also tested with Google Docs.</description>

      <description>During an Indirect Prompt Injection Attack an adversary can exfiltrate chat data from a user by instructing ChatGPT to render images and append information to the URL (Image Markdown Injection), or by tricking a user to click a hyperlink.&#xA;Sending large amounts of data to a third party server via URLs might seem inconvenient or limiting&amp;hellip;&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s say we want something more, aehm, powerful, elegant and exciting.&#xA;ChatGPT Plugins and Exfiltration Limitations Plugins are an extension mechanism with little security oversight or enforced review process.</description>

      <description>ChatGPT is vulnerable to data exfiltration via image markdown injections. This. is. pretty well known.&#xA;As more features are added to ChatGPT the exfiltration angle becomes more likely to be abused.&#xA;Recently OpenAI added Custom Instructions, which allow to have ChatGPT always automatically append instructions to every message exchange.&#xA;An adversary can abuse this feature to install a data exfiltration backdoor that depends on, and only works because of the image markdown injection vulnerability.</description>

      <description>In the previous post we discussed the risks of OAuth enabled plugins being commonly vulnerable to Cross Plugin Request Forgery and how OpenAI is seemingly not enforcing new plugin store policies. As an example we explored how the &amp;ldquo;Chat with Code&amp;rdquo; plugin is vulnerable. Recently, a post on Reddit titled &amp;ldquo;This is scary! Posting stuff by itself&amp;rdquo; shows how a conversation with ChatGPT, out of the blue (and what appears to be by accident) created a Github Issue!</description>

      <description>OpenAI continues to add plugins with security vulnerabilities to their store.&#xA;In particular powerful plugins that can impersonate a user are not getting the required security scrutiny, or a general mitigation at the platform level.&#xA;As a brief reminder, one of the challenges Large Language Model (LLM) User-Agents, like ChatGPT, and plugins face is the Confused Deputy Problem / Plugin Request Forgery Attacks, which means that during a Prompt Injection attack an adversary can issue commands to plugins to cause harm.</description>

      <description>To help raise awareness of Indirect Prompt Injections and other related attacks, I put together a little fun mini app that you can invoke with ChatGPT.&#xA;Visit this link with GPT-4 and Browsing enabled (see Appendix, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what that means):&#xA;https://wuzzi.net/matrix The website will hijack ChatGPT via an indirect prompt injection and then allow you to enter the matrix, if you decide to do so.&#xA;Note: You can&amp;rsquo;t browse to the URL, it will only respond to ChatGPT.</description>

      <description>If you are building ChatGPT plugins, LLM agents, tools or integrations this is a must read. This post explains how the first exploitable Cross Plugin Request Forgery was found in the wild and the fix which was applied.&#xA;Indirect Prompt Injections Are Now A Reality With plugins and browsing support Indirect Prompt Injections are now a reality in the ChatGPT ecosystem.&#xA;The real-world examples and demos provided by others and myself to raise awarness about this increasing problem have been mostly amusing and harmless, like making Bing Chat speak like a pirate, make ChatGPT add jokes at the end or having it do a Rickroll when reading YouTube transcripts.</description>

      <description>This post shows how a malicious website can take control of a ChatGPT chat session and exfiltrate the history of the conversation.&#xA;Plugins, Tools and Integrations With plugins, data exfiltration can happen by sending too much data into the plugin in the first place. More security controls and insights on what is being sent to the plugin are required to empower users.&#xA;However, this post is not about sending too much data to a plugin, but about a malicious actor who controls the data a plugin retrieves.</description>

      <description>As discussed previously the problem of Indirect Prompt Injections is increasing.&#xA;They start showing up in many places.&#xA;A new unique one that I ran across is YouTube transcripts. ChatGPT (via Plugins) can access YouTube transcripts. Which is pretty neat. However, as expected (and predicted by many researches) all these quickly built tools and integrations introduce Indirect Prompt Injection vulnerabilities.&#xA;Proof of Concept Here is how it looks with ChatGPT end to end with a demo example.</description>
