      <description>This post is part of a series about machine learning and artificial intelligence.&#xA;Adversaries often leverage supply chain attacks to gain footholds. In machine learning model deserialization issues are a significant threat, and detecting them is crucial, as they can lead to arbitrary code execution. We explored this attack with Python Pickle files in the past.&#xA;In this post we are covering backdooring the original Keras Husky AI model from the Machine Learning Attack Series, and afterwards we investigate tooling to detect the backdoor.</description>

      <description>Hack and protect Machine Learning Systems so that we don&amp;rsquo;t get stuck in the matrix!&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost three years since I started the Machine Learning Attack Series, and my interest in attacking and leveraging AI and Machine Learning is unbroken.&#xA;There is so much to learn and explore, particularly in bridging the gap between traditional security engineering and machine learning. As followers of this blog will know, this is an area I have been exploring in-depth over the past few years.</description>

      <description>Recently I read this excellent post by Evan Sultanik about exploiting pickle files on Trail of Bits. There was also a DefCon30 talk about backdooring pickle files by ColdwaterQ.&#xA;This got me curious to try out backdooring a pickle file myself.&#xA;Pickle files - the surprises Surprisingly Python pickle files are compiled programs running in a VM called the Pickle Machine (PM). Opcodes control the flow, and when there are opcodes there is often fun to be had.</description>

      <description>Today you are in for a special treat. Did you know that an adversary can hide a smaller image within a larger one?&#xA;This video demonstrates how a small image becomes magically visible when the computer resizes the large image, and also how to mitigate the vulnerability.&#xA;This is possible when vulnerable code uses insecure interpolation.&#xA;If you like this one check out the overall Machine Learning Attack Series.&#xA;Credit for original research, Erwing Quiring, et al.</description>

      <description>This post is part of the machine learning attack series.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while that I did a Husky AI and offensive machine learning related post. This weekend I had some time to try out Counterfit. My goal was to understand what Counterfit is, how it works, and use it to turn Shadowbunny into a husky.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&#xA;What is Counterfit? With Counterfit you can test your machine learning models and endpoints for specific adversarial attacks.</description>

      <description>What a journey it has been. I wrote quite a bit about machine learning from a red teaming/security testing perspective this year. It was brought to my attention to provide a conveninent &amp;ldquo;index page&amp;rdquo; with all Husky AI and related blog posts. Here it is.&#xA;Machine Learning Basics and Building Husky AI Getting the hang of machine learning The machine learning pipeline and attacks Husky AI: Building a machine learning system MLOps - Operationalizing the machine learning model Threat Modeling and Strategies Threat modeling a machine learning system Grayhat Red Team Village Video: Building and breaking a machine learning system Assume Bias and Responsible AI Practical Attacks and Defenses Brute forcing images to find incorrect predictions Smart brute forcing Perturbations to misclassify existing images Adversarial Robustness Toolbox Basics Image Scaling Attacks Stealing a model file: Attacker gains read access to the model Backdooring models: Attacker modifies persisted model file Repudiation Threat and Auditing: Catching modifications and unauthorized access Attacker modifies Jupyter Notebook file to insert a backdoor CVE 2020-16977: VS Code Python Extension Remote Code Execution Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create fake husky images Using Microsoft Counterfit to create adversarial examples Backdooring Pickle Files Backdooring Keras Model Files and How to Detect It Miscellaneous Participating in the Microsoft Machine Learning Security Evasion Competition - Bypassing malware models by signing binaries Husky AI Github Repo Conclusion As you can see there are many machine learning specific attacks, but also a lot of &amp;ldquo;typical&amp;rdquo; red teaming techniques that put AI/ML systems at risk.</description>

      <description>In this post we will explore Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create fake husky images. The goal is, of course, to have &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo; misclassify them as real huskies.&#xA;If you want to learn more about Husky AI visit the Overview post.&#xA;Generative Adversarial Networks One of the attacks I wanted to investigate for a while was the creation of fake images to trick Husky AI. The best approach seemed by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).</description>

      <description>My GrayHat Red Team Village talk &amp;ldquo;Learning by doing: Building and breaking a machine learning system&amp;rdquo; is now live on YouTube.&#xA;Check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SV80sIBhqY and smash the Like button! :D&#xA;Question? I thought of turning the content into a hands-on workshop. Let me know if that would be something that would you would attend?

      <description>While building &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo; I started working a lot with Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s VS Code Python extension. It is a super convinient way to edit Jupyter Notebooks. I just use VS Code&amp;rsquo;s Remote SSH feature to get to my Linux host and work on modeling and testing there.&#xA;When threat modeling &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo; I identified backdooring of third party libraries and development tools as a potential issue to be aware of.&#xA;So finding security issues in the tools is naturally something I am keeping an eye on.</description>
