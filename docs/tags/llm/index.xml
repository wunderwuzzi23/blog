      <description>Imagine your AI rewriting your personal history&amp;hellip;
A while ago Google added memories to Gemini. Memories allow Gemini to store user-related data across sessions, storing information in long-term memory. The feature is only available to users who subscribe to Gemini Advanced so far. So, in the fall of last year I chimed in and paid for the subscription for a month to check it out.
As a user you can see what Gemini stored about you at https://gemini.</description>

      <description>At Black Hat Europe I did a fun presentation titled SpAIware and More: Advanced Prompt Injection Exploits. Without diving into the details of the entire talk, the key point I was making is that prompt injection can impact all aspects of the CIA security triad.
However, there is one part that I want to highlight explicitly:

      <description>I regularly look at how the system prompts of chatbots change over time. Updates frequently highlight new features being added, design changes that occur and potential areas that might benefit from more security scrutiny.
A few months back I noticed an interesting update to the M365 Copilot (BizChat) system prompt. In particular, there used to be one enterprise_search tool in the past. You might remember that tool was used during the Copirate ASCII Smuggling exploit to search for MFA codes in the user&amp;rsquo;s inbox.</description>

      <description>Happy to share that I authored the paper &amp;ldquo;Trust No AI: Prompt Injection Along The CIA Security Triad&amp;rdquo;.
You can download it from arxiv.
The paper examines how prompt injection attacks can compromise Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of AI systems, with real-world examples targeting vendors like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and Microsoft.
It summarizes many of the prompt injection examples I explained on this blog, and I hope it helps bridge the gap between traditional cybersecurity and academic AI/ML research, fostering stronger understanding and defenses against these emerging threats.</description>

      <description>Last week Leon Derczynski described how LLMs can output ANSI escape codes. These codes, also known as control characters, are interpreted by terminal emulators and modify behavior.
This discovery resonates with areas I had been exploring, so I took some time to apply, and build upon, these newly uncovered insights.

      <description>A few days ago, Anthropic released Claude Computer Use, which is a model + code that allows Claude to control a computer. It takes screenshots to make decisions, can run bash commands and so forth.
It&amp;rsquo;s cool, but obviously very dangerous because of prompt injection. Claude Computer Use enables AI to run commands on machines autonomously, posing severe risks if exploited via prompt injection.

Disclaimer So, first a disclaimer: Claude Computer Use is a Beta Feature and what you are going to see is a fundamental design problem in state-of-the-art LLM-powered Applications and Agents.</description>

      <description>This post explains an attack chain for the ChatGPT macOS application. Through prompt injection from untrusted data, attackers could insert long-term persistent spyware into ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s memory. This led to continuous data exfiltration of any information the user typed or responses received by ChatGPT, including any future chat sessions.
 OpenAI released a fix for the macOS app last week. Ensure your app is updated to the latest version.

      <description>This post describes vulnerability in Microsoft 365 Copilot that allowed the theft of a user&amp;rsquo;s emails and other personal information. This vulnerability warrants a deep dive, because it combines a variety of novel attack techniques that are not even two years old.

I initially disclosed parts of this exploit to Microsoft in January, and then the full exploit chain in February 2024. A few days ago I got the okay from MSRC to disclose this report.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2024/google-ai-studio-data-exfiltration-now-fixed/</guid>
      <description>Recently, I found what appeared to be a regression or bypass that again allowed data exfiltration via image rendering during prompt injection. See the previous post here for reference.
Data Exfiltration via Rendering HTML Image Tags During re-testing, I had sporadic success with markdown rendering tricks, but eventually, I was able to drastically simplify the exploit by asking directly for an HTML image tag.
This behavior might actually have existed all along, as Google AI Studio hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet implemented any kind of Content Security Policy to prevent communication with arbitrary domains using images.</description>

      <description>Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Copilot Studio is a powerful, easy-to-use, low-code platform that enables employees in an organization to create chatbots. Previously known as Power Virtual Agents, it has been updated (including GenAI features) and rebranded to Copilot Studio, likely to align with current AI trends.

This post discusses security risks to be aware of when using Copilot Studio, focusing on data leaks, unauthorized access, and how external adversaries can find and interact with misconfigured Copilots.</description>

      <description>Google Colab AI, now just called Gemini in Colab, was vulnerable to data leakage via image rendering.
This is an older bug report, dating back to November 29, 2023. However, recent events prompted me to write this up:
 Google did not reward this finding, and Colab now automatically puts Notebook content (untrusted data) into the prompt.  Let&amp;rsquo;s explore the specifics.

      <description>Recently, OpenAI announced gpt-4o-mini and there are some interesting updates, including safety improvements regarding &amp;ldquo;Instruction Hierarchy&amp;rdquo;:

OpenAI puts this in the light of &amp;ldquo;safety&amp;rdquo;, the word security is not mentioned in the announcement.
Additionally, this The Verge article titled &amp;ldquo;OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s latest model will block the &amp;lsquo;ignore all previous instructions&amp;rsquo; loophole&amp;rdquo; created interesting discussions on X, including a first demo bypass.
I spent some time this weekend to get a better intuition about gpt-4o-mini model and instruction hierarchy, and the conclusion is that system instructions are still not a security boundary.</description>

      <description>This post highlights how the GitHub Copilot Chat VS Code Extension was vulnerable to data exfiltration via prompt injection when analyzing untrusted source code.
GitHub Copilot Chat GitHub Copilot Chat is a VS Code Extension that allows a user to chat with source code, refactor code, get info about terminal output, or general help about VS Code, and things along those lines.
It does so by sending source code, along with the user&amp;rsquo;s questions to a large language model (LLM).</description>

      <description>OpenAI recently introduced a memory feature in ChatGPT, enabling it to recall information across sessions, creating a more personalized user experience.
However, with this new capability comes risks. Imagine if an attacker could manipulate your AI assistant (chatbot or agent) to remember false information, bias or even instructions, or delete all your memories! This is not a futuristic scenario, the attack that makes this possible is called Indirect Prompt Injection.</description>

      <description>Google&amp;rsquo;s NotebookLM is an experimental project that was released last year. It allows users to upload files and analyze them with a large language model (LLM).
However, it is vulnerable to Prompt Injection, meaning that uploaded files can manipulate the chat conversation and control what the user sees in responses.
There is currently no known solution to these kinds of attacks, so users can&amp;rsquo;t implicitly trust responses from large language model applications when untrusted data is involved.</description>

      <description>Your Code Interpreter sandbox, also known as Advanced Data Analysis sessions, are shared between private and public GPTs. Yes, your actual compute container and its storage is shared. Each user gets their own isolated container, but if a user uses multiple GPTs and stores files in Code Interpreter all GPTs can access (and also overwrite) each others files.
This is true also for files uploaded/created with private GPTs and ChatGPT itself.</description>

A quick reminder: Unicode Tags code points are invisible in UI elements, but ChatGPT was able to interpret them and follow hidden instructions. Riley Goodside discovered it.
What about Anthropic Claude? While waiting for a flight I figured to look at Anthropic Claude. Turns out it has the same issue as ChatGPT had.</description>

      <description>Last November Google had an interesting update to Google Bard. This updated included the ability to solve math equations and draw charts based on data.
What does this mean and why is it interesting?
It means that Google Bard has access to a computer and can run more complex programs, including Python code that plots graphs!
Let&amp;rsquo;s explore this with a simple example.
Drawing Charts with Google Bard The following prompt will create a chart:</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago Amazon released the Preview of Amazon Q for Business, and after looking at it I found a data exfiltration angle via rendering markdown/hyperlinks and reported it to Amazon.
Amazon reacted quickly and mitigated the problem. This post shares further details and how it was fixed.
The Problem An Indirect Prompt Injection attack can cause the LLM to return markdown tags. This allows an adversary who&amp;rsquo;s data makes it into the chat context (e.</description>

      <description>A few days ago Riley Goodside posted about an interesting discovery on how an LLM prompt injection can happen via invisible instructions in pasted text. This works by using a special set of Unicode code points from the Tags Unicode Block.
The proof-of-concept showed how a simple text contained invisible instructions that caused ChatGPT to invoke DALL-E to create an image.
Hidden Instructions for LLMs The meaning of these &amp;ldquo;Tags&amp;rdquo; seems to have gone through quite some churn, from language tags to eventually being repurposed for some emojis.</description>

      <description>Five years ago I gave a Lightning Talk at the 35th Chaos Communication Congress called &amp;ldquo;Pass the Cookie and Pivot to the Clouds&amp;rdquo;. It was a talk about my very first blog post on Embrace The Red just a few weeks earlier in December 2018.
Fast forward to 2023&amp;hellip; it was great to attend the 37C3 in person in Hamburg this year. The Congress was packed with great talks, amazing people, awesome events and side quests and I got to present also!</description>

      <description>When OpenAI released GPTs last month I had plans for an interesting GPT.
Malicious ChatGPT Agents The idea was to create a kind of malware GPT that forwards users&#39; chat messages to a third party server. It also asks users for personal information like emails and passwords.
Why would this be possible end to end? ChatGPT cannot guarantee to keep your conversation private or confidential, because it loads images from any website.</description>

      <description>To learn more about Prompt Engineering and Prompt Injections I put together this tutorial + lab for myself. It is as a Jupyter Notebook to experiement and play around with this novel attack technique, learn and experiment.
The examples reach from simple prompt engineering scenarios, such as changing the output message to a specific text, to more complex adversarial prompt challenges such as JSON object injection, HTML injection/XSS, overwriting mail recipients or orders of an OrderBot and also data exfiltration.</description>
