      <description>On the day AWS Kiro was released, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist putting it through some of my Month of AI Bugs security tests for coding agents.&#xA;AWS Kiro was vulnerable to arbitrary command execution via indirect prompt injection. This means that a remote attacker, who controls data that Kiro processes, could hijack it to run arbitrary operating system commands or write and run custom code.&#xA;In particular two attack paths that enabled this with AWS Kiro were identified:</description>

      <description>Today we will cover a powerful, easy to use, autonomous agent called Manus. Manus is developed by the Chinese startup Butterfly Effect, headquartered in Singapore.&#xA;This post demonstrates an end-to-end indirect prompt injection attack leading to a compromise of Manus&amp;rsquo; dev box.&#xA;This is achieved by tricking Manus to expose it&amp;rsquo;s internal VS Code Server to the Internet, and then sharing the URL and password with the atacker. Specifically, this post demonstrates that:</description>

      <description>Imagine a malicious instruction hidden in plain sight, invisible to you but not to the AI. This is a vulnerability discovered in Windsurf Cascade, it follows invisible instructions. This means there can be instructions in a file or result of a tool call that the developer cannot see, but the LLM does.&#xA;Some LLMs interpret invisible Unicode Tag characters as instructions, which can lead to hidden prompt injection.&#xA;As far as I can tell the Windsurf SWE-1 model can also &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; these invisible characters, but the SWE-1 is not yet capable of interpreting them as instructions.</description>

      <description>In this second post about Windsurf Cascade we are exploring the SpAIware attack, which allows memory persistent data exfiltration. SpAIware is an attack we first successfully demonstrated with ChatGPT last year and OpenAI mitigated.&#xA;While inspecting the system prompt of Windsurf Cascade I noticed that it has a create_memory tool.&#xA;Creating Memories The question that immediately popped into my head was if this tool will require human approval when Cascade creates a long-term memory, or if it is added automatically.</description>

      <description>This is the first post in a series exploring security vulnerabilities in Windsurf. If you are unfamiliar with Windsurf, it is a fork of VS Code and the coding agent is called Windsurf Cascade.&#xA;The attack vectors we will explore today allow an adversary during an indirect prompt injection to exfiltrate data from the developer&amp;rsquo;s machine.&#xA;These vulnerabilities are a great example of Simon Willison&amp;rsquo;s lethal trifecta pattern.&#xA;Overall, the security vulnerability reporting experience with Windsurf has not been great.</description>

      <description>In this post we will look at Amp, a coding agent from Sourcegraph. The other day we discussed how invisible instructions impact Google Jules.&#xA;Turns out that many client applications are vulnerable to these kinds of attacks when they use models that support invisible instructions, like Claude.&#xA;Invisible Unicode Tag Characters Interpreted as Instructions We have talked about hidden prompt injections quite a bit in the past, and so I&amp;rsquo;m keeping this short.</description>

      <description>The latest Gemini models quite reliably interpret hidden Unicode Tag characters as instructions. This vulnerability, first reported to Google over a year ago, has not been mitigated at the model or API level, hence now affects all applications built on top of Gemini.&#xA;This includes Google&amp;rsquo;s own products and services, like Google Jules.&#xA;Hopefully, this post helps raise awareness of this emerging threat.&#xA;Invisible Prompt Injections in GitHub Issues When Jules is asked to work on a task, such as a GitHub issue, it is possible to plant invisible instructions into a GitHub issue to add backdoor code, or have it run arbitrary commands and tools.</description>

      <description>This post explores data exfiltration attacks in Google Jules, an asynchronous coding agent. This is the first of three posts that will highlight my research on Google Jules in May 2025. All information provided was also shared with Google at that time.&#xA;This first post will focus on data exfiltration, the lethal trifecta.&#xA;But let&amp;rsquo;s first talk about Jules&amp;rsquo; system prompt.&#xA;Jules&amp;rsquo; System Prompt and Multiple Agents To grab the system prompt I just asked it to write it into a file.</description>

      <description>This post is about an important, but also scary, prompt injection discovery that leads to full system compromise of the developer&amp;rsquo;s machine in GitHub Copilot and VS Code.&#xA;It is achieved by placing Copilot into YOLO mode by modifying the project’s settings.json file.&#xA;As described a few days ago with Amp, a vulnerability pattern in agents that might be overlooked is that if an agent can write to files and modify its own configuration or update security-relevant settings it can lead to remote code execution.</description>

      <description>When the Model Context Protocol (MCP) came out it reminded me of the Common Object Model (COM) from Microsoft.&#xA;COM has been around for decades and it&amp;rsquo;s used for programming, scripting, sharing of functionality at a binary/object level across languages and hosts. Via DCOM all of this can even be done remotely, and well, it&amp;rsquo;s also useful for red teaming. A lot of software on Windows was/is implemented as COM objects, including Microsoft Office.</description>

      <description>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol definition for how LLM apps/agents can leverage external tools. I have been calling it Model Control Protocol at times, because due to prompt injection, MCP tool servers control the client basically.&#xA;This post will explain in detail why that is, and I will also share a novel exploit chain.&#xA;Why MCP - How Is It Different? The main difference to other tool invocation setups, like OpenAPI is that MCP is dynamic.</description>

      <description>You are likely aware of ASCII Smuggling via Unicode Tags. It is unique and fascinating because many LLMs inherently interpret these as instructions when delivered as hidden prompt injection, and LLMs can also emit them. Then, a few weeks ago, a post on Hacker News demonstrated how Variant Selectors can be used to smuggle data.&#xA;This inspired me to take this further and build Sneaky Bits, where we can encode any Unicode character (or sequence of bytes for that matter) with the usage of only two invisible characters.</description>

      <description>I regularly look at how the system prompts of chatbots change over time. Updates frequently highlight new features being added, design changes that occur and potential areas that might benefit from more security scrutiny.&#xA;A few months back I noticed an interesting update to the M365 Copilot (BizChat) system prompt. In particular, there used to be one enterprise_search tool in the past. You might remember that tool was used during the Copirate ASCII Smuggling exploit to search for MFA codes in the user&amp;rsquo;s inbox.</description>

It takes screenshots to make decisions, can run bash commands and so forth.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s cool, but obviously very dangerous because of prompt injection. Claude Computer Use enables AI to run commands on machines autonomously, posing severe risks if exploited via prompt injection.&#xA;Disclaimer So, first a disclaimer: Claude Computer Use is a Beta Feature and what you are going to see is a fundamental design problem in state-of-the-art LLM-powered Applications and Agents.</description>

      <description>What I like about the rapid advancements and excitement about AI over the last few years is that we see a resurgence of the testing discipline!&#xA;Software testing is hard, and adding AI to the mix does not make it easier at all!&#xA;Google AI Studio - Initially not vulnerable to data leakage via image rendering When Google released AI Studio last year I checked for the common image markdown data exfiltration vulnerability and it was not vulnerable.</description>

      <description>About a year ago we talked about how developers can&amp;rsquo;t intrinsically trust LLM responses and common threats that AI Chatbots face and how attackers can exploit them, including ways to exfiltrate data.&#xA;One of the threats is unfurling of hyperlinks, which can lead to data exfiltration and is something often seen in Chatbots. So, let&amp;rsquo;s shine more light on it, including practical guidance on how to mitigate it with the example of Slack Apps.</description>

      <description>Building reliable prompt injection payloads is challenging at times. It&amp;rsquo;s this new world with large language model (LLM) applications that can be instructed with natural language and they mostly follow instructions&amp;hellip; but not always.&#xA;Attackers have the same challenges around prompt engineering as normal users.&#xA;Prompt Injection Exploit Development Attacks always get better over time. And as more features are being added to LLM applications, the degrees of freedom for attackers increases as well.</description>

      <description>Your Code Interpreter sandbox, also known as Advanced Data Analysis sessions, are shared between private and public GPTs. Yes, your actual compute container and its storage is shared. Each user gets their own isolated container, but if a user uses multiple GPTs and stores files in Code Interpreter all GPTs can access (and also overwrite) each others files.&#xA;This is true also for files uploaded/created with private GPTs and ChatGPT itself.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago hidden prompt injections were discovered and we covered it at the time.&#xA;This video explains it in more detail, and also highlights implications beyond hiding instructions, including what I call ASCII Smuggling. This is the usage of Unicode Tags Block characters to both craft and deciper hidden messages in plain sight.&#xA;Using Unicode encoding to bypass security features or execute code (XSS, SSRF,..) has been in use for a while, however this new TTP enables more sophisticated attack scenarios.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago while waiting at the airport lounge I was wondering how other Chatbots, besides ChatGPT, handle hidden Unicode Tags code points.&#xA;A quick reminder: Unicode Tags code points are invisible in UI elements, but ChatGPT was able to interpret them and follow hidden instructions. Riley Goodside discovered it.&#xA;What about Anthropic Claude? While waiting for a flight I figured to look at Anthropic Claude. Turns out it has the same issue as ChatGPT had.</description>

      <description>Last November Google had an interesting update to Google Bard. This updated included the ability to solve math equations and draw charts based on data.&#xA;What does this mean and why is it interesting?&#xA;It means that Google Bard has access to a computer and can run more complex programs, including Python code that plots graphs!&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s explore this with a simple example.&#xA;Drawing Charts with Google Bard The following prompt will create a chart:</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago Amazon released the Preview of Amazon Q for Business, and after looking at it I found a data exfiltration angle via rendering markdown/hyperlinks and reported it to Amazon.&#xA;Amazon reacted quickly and mitigated the problem. This post shares further details and how it was fixed.&#xA;The Problem An Indirect Prompt Injection attack can cause the LLM to return markdown tags. This allows an adversary who&amp;rsquo;s data makes it into the chat context (e.</description>

      <description>A few days ago Riley Goodside posted about an interesting discovery on how an LLM prompt injection can happen via invisible instructions in pasted text. This works by using a special set of Unicode code points from the Tags Unicode Block.&#xA;The proof-of-concept showed how a simple text contained invisible instructions that caused ChatGPT to invoke DALL-E to create an image.&#xA;Hidden Instructions for LLMs The meaning of these &amp;ldquo;Tags&amp;rdquo; seems to have gone through quite some churn, from language tags to eventually being repurposed for some emojis.</description>

      <description>Five years ago I gave a Lightning Talk at the 35th Chaos Communication Congress called &amp;ldquo;Pass the Cookie and Pivot to the Clouds&amp;rdquo;. It was a talk about my very first blog post on Embrace The Red just a few weeks earlier in December 2018.&#xA;Fast forward to 2023&amp;hellip; it was great to attend the 37C3 in person in Hamburg this year. The Congress was packed with great talks, amazing people, awesome events and side quests and I got to present also!</description>

      <description>When OpenAI released GPTs last month I had plans for an interesting GPT.&#xA;Malicious ChatGPT Agents The idea was to create a kind of malware GPT that forwards users&amp;rsquo; chat messages to a third party server. It also asks users for personal information like emails and passwords.&#xA;Why would this be possible end to end? ChatGPT cannot guarantee to keep your conversation private or confidential, because it loads images from any website.</description>

      <description>To learn more about Prompt Engineering and Prompt Injections I put together this tutorial + lab for myself. It is as a Jupyter Notebook to experiement and play around with this novel attack technique, learn and experiment.&#xA;The examples reach from simple prompt engineering scenarios, such as changing the output message to a specific text, to more complex adversarial prompt challenges such as JSON object injection, HTML injection/XSS, overwriting mail recipients or orders of an OrderBot and also data exfiltration.</description>
