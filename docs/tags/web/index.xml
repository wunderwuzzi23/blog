      <description>Final Year Project - Web Application Security Principles About 18 years ago I worked on the final year project for my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science. I had just gotten interested in security and was learning about security principles.
The title of the project was &amp;ldquo;Web Application Security Principles - Designing Secure Web Based Enterprise Solutions&amp;rdquo;.
Looking back, a really cool thing was that I had just started working at Microsoft as an Associate Development Consultant and was bold enough to send the paper last minute over to Michael Howard - who responded and indeed reviewed it!</description>
