      <description>This post is part of a series about Offensive BPF. Click the &amp;ldquo;ebpf&amp;rdquo; tag to see all related posts.&#xA;It has been a while that we posted something in the &amp;ldquo;Offensive BPF&amp;rdquo; series. But recently there have been a couple of new cool ebpf based tools, such as TripleCross, boopkit and pamspy.&#xA;So, I thought it be quite fitting to do another post in the Offensive BPF series to keep raising awareness.</description>

      <description>This post is part of a series about Offensive BPF that I&amp;rsquo;m working on to learn about BPF to understand attacks and defenses. Click the &amp;ldquo;ebpf&amp;rdquo; tag to see all relevant posts.&#xA;In the previous posts I spend time learning about bpftrace which is quite powerful. This post is focused on basics and using existing BPF tools, rather then building new BPF programs from scratch.&#xA;Living off the land: bpfcc-tools Performance and observability teams are pushing for BPF tooling to be present in production.</description>

Click the &amp;ldquo;ebpf&amp;rdquo; tag to see all relevant posts.&#xA;In the last post we talked about a basic bpftrace script to install a BPF program that runs commands upon connecting from a specific IP with a specific magic source port.&#xA;This post will dive into this idea more by leveraging more a complex solution.</description>

So, I wanted to see if/how bpftrace, a popular tool for running BPF programs, can be used to create potential backdoors, and what evidence to look for as defenders.</description>

      <description>Over the last few years eBPF has gained a lot of traction in the Linux community and beyond.&#xA;eBPF&amp;rsquo;s offensive usage is also slowly getting more attention. So, I decided to dive into the topic from a red teaming point of view to learn about it to raise awareness and share the journey.&#xA;Similar to the format of my Machine Learning Attack Series, there will be a serious of posts around BPF usage in offensive settings, and also how its misuse can be detected.</description>
