      <title>Video: ASCII Smuggling and Hidden Prompt Instructions</title>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago hidden prompt injections were discovered and we covered it at the time.&#xA;This video explains it in more detail, and also highlights implications beyond hiding instructions, including what I call ASCII Smuggling. This is the usage of Unicode Tags Block characters to both craft and deciper hidden messages in plain sight.&#xA;Using Unicode encoding to bypass security features or execute code (XSS, SSRF,..) has been in use for a while, however this new TTP enables more sophisticated attack scenarios.</description>

      <title>37th Chaos Communication Congress: New Important Instructions (Video &#43; Slides)</title>

      <description>Five years ago I gave a Lightning Talk at the 35th Chaos Communication Congress called &amp;ldquo;Pass the Cookie and Pivot to the Clouds&amp;rdquo;. It was a talk about my very first blog post on Embrace The Red just a few weeks earlier in December 2018.&#xA;Fast forward to 2023&amp;hellip; it was great to attend the 37C3 in person in Hamburg this year. The Congress was packed with great talks, amazing people, awesome events and side quests and I got to present also!</description>

      <title>Video: Data Exfiltration Vulnerabilities in LLM apps (Bing Chat, ChatGPT, Claude)</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/video-data-exfiltration-vulns-in-llm-applictions/</link>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/video-data-exfiltration-vulns-in-llm-applictions/</guid>
      <description>This video highlights the various data exfiltration vulnerabilities I discovered and responsibly disclosed to Microsoft, Anthropic, ChatGPT and Plugin Developers.&#xA;It also briefly discusses mitigations various vendors put in place (and triage decisions).&#xA;Thanks to MSRC, Anthropic and Zapier for addressing vulnerabilities to help protect their users.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s hope it inspires OpenAI to mitigate the image markdown injection issue finally as well. It&amp;rsquo;s rated as a CVSS High scored vulnerability basically and was first reported to them on April, 9th 2023 - the triage decision was &amp;ldquo;won&amp;rsquo;t fix&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Prompting: Tutorial and Lab</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/adversarial-prompting-tutorial-and-lab/</link>

      <description>To learn more about Prompt Engineering and Prompt Injections I put together this tutorial + lab for myself. It is as a Jupyter Notebook to experiement and play around with this novel attack technique, learn and experiment.&#xA;The examples reach from simple prompt engineering scenarios, such as changing the output message to a specific text, to more complex adversarial prompt challenges such as JSON object injection, HTML injection/XSS, overwriting mail recipients or orders of an OrderBot and also data exfiltration.</description>

      <title>Video: Prompt Injections - An Introduction</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/prompt-injection-an-introduction-video/</link>

      <description>There are many prompt engineering classes and currently pretty much all examples are vulnerable to Prompt Injections. Especially Indirect Prompt Injections are dangerous as we discussed before.&#xA;Indirect Prompt Injections allow untrusted data to take control of the LLM (large language model) and give an AI a new instructions, mission and objective.&#xA;Bypassing Input Validation Attack payloads are natural language. This means there are lots of creative ways an adversary can inject malicious data that bypass input filters and web application firewalls.</description>

      <title>Video: Understanding Image Scaling Attacks</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2021/video-image-scaling-attacks/</link>

      <description>Today you are in for a special treat. Did you know that an adversary can hide a smaller image within a larger one?&#xA;This video demonstrates how a small image becomes magically visible when the computer resizes the large image, and also how to mitigate the vulnerability.&#xA;This is possible when vulnerable code uses insecure interpolation.&#xA;If you like this one check out the overall Machine Learning Attack Series.&#xA;Credit for original research, Erwing Quiring, et al.</description>

      <title>Video: What is Tabnabbing?</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2021/what-is-tab-nabbing/</link>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2021/what-is-tab-nabbing/</guid>
      <description>Tabnabbing is a web application security vulnerability that can be used to perform phishing attacks, so its important to be aware of it as a developer and penetration tester.&#xA;It is easy to mitigate and in this short video we cover both attacks and mitigations.&#xA;Thanks for reading and happy hacking!&#xA;@wunderwuzzi23</description>

      <title>Video: Web Application Security Fundamentals</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2021/web-application-security-fundamentals-video/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 08:02:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2021/web-application-security-fundamentals-video/</guid>
      <description>In this 25 minute video I&amp;rsquo;m explaining the foundations of Web Application Security.&#xA;The video covers the basic building blocks of web applications, such as HTML, HTTP, JavaScript and Cookies. Furthermore core web applications security concepts such as the Same-Origin Policy are discussed in detail.&#xA;The goal is to provide foundational knowledge to help grasp security vulnerabilities, such as XSS, CSRF, SQLi, tab-nabbing, etc. later on.&#xA;In the past I have trained and presented content like this to thousands of engineers at large organizations and cloud providers, hence its quite optimized for best learning and comprehension outcome.</description>
