      <description>OpenAI continues to add plugins with security vulnerabilities to their store.
In particular powerful plugins that can impersonate a user are not getting the required security scrutiny, or a general mitigation at the platform level.
As a brief reminder, one of the challenges Large Language Model (LLM) User-Agents, like ChatGPT, and plugins face is the Confused Deputy Problem / Plugin Request Forgery Attacks, which means that during a Prompt Injection attack an adversary can issue commands to plugins to cause harm.</description>

      <title>Bing Chat: Data Exfiltration Exploit Explained</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/bing-chat-data-exfiltration-poc-and-fix/</link>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/bing-chat-data-exfiltration-poc-and-fix/</guid>
      <description>This post describes how I found a Prompt Injection attack angle in Bing Chat that allowed malicious text on a webpage (like a user comment or an advertisement) to exfiltrate data.
The Vulnerability - Image Markdown Injection When Bing Chat returns text it can return markdown elements, which the client will render as HTML. This includes the feature to include images.
Imagine the LLM returns the following text:

      <description>To help raise awareness of Indirect Prompt Injections and other related attacks, I put together a little fun mini app that you can invoke with ChatGPT.
Visit this link with GPT-4 and Browsing enabled (see Appendix, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what that means):
https://wuzzi.net/matrix The website will hijack ChatGPT via an indirect prompt injection and then allow you to enter the matrix, if you decide to do so.

Note: You can&amp;rsquo;t browse to the URL, it will only respond to ChatGPT.</description>

      <description>If you are building ChatGPT plugins, LLM agents, tools or integrations this is a must read. This post explains how the first exploitable Cross Plugin Request Forgery was found in the wild and the fix which was applied.
Indirect Prompt Injections Are Now A Reality With plugins and browsing support Indirect Prompt Injections are now a reality in the ChatGPT ecosystem.
The real-world examples and demos provided by others and myself to raise awarness about this increasing problem have been mostly amusing and harmless, like making Bing Chat speak like a pirate, make ChatGPT add jokes at the end or having it do a Rickroll when reading YouTube transcripts.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/chatgpt-webpilot-data-exfil-via-markdown-injection/</guid>
      <description>This post shows how a malicious website can take control of a ChatGPT chat session and exfiltrate the history of the conversation.
Plugins, Tools and Integrations With plugins, data exfiltration can happen by sending too much data into the plugin in the first place. More security controls and insights on what is being sent to the plugin are required to empower users.
However, this post is not about sending too much data to a plugin, but about a malicious actor who controls the data a plugin retrieves.</description>

      <description>As discussed previously the problem of Indirect Prompt Injections is increasing.
They start showing up in many places.
A new unique one that I ran across is YouTube transcripts. ChatGPT (via Plugins) can access YouTube transcripts. Which is pretty neat. However, as expected (and predicted by many researches) all these quickly built tools and integrations introduce Indirect Prompt Injection vulnerabilities.
Proof of Concept Here is how it looks with ChatGPT end to end with a demo example.</description>

      <description>Hack and protect Machine Learning Systems so that we don&amp;rsquo;t get stuck in the matrix!
It&amp;rsquo;s been almost three years since I started the Machine Learning Attack Series, and my interest in attacking and leveraging AI and Machine Learning is unbroken.
There is so much to learn and explore, particularly in bridging the gap between traditional security engineering and machine learning. As followers of this blog will know, this is an area I have been exploring in-depth over the past few years.</description>

      <description>Playing around with Bing Chat is quite fun. Until today I mostly used ChatGPT and GPT-4 directly, but I was curious of the capabilites and restrictions of Bing Chat.
I noticed that as soon as I mentioned the word &amp;ldquo;hacker&amp;rdquo;, Bing Chat became quite &amp;ldquo;uncomfortable&amp;rdquo;. For instance, when I asked it to imagine being a hacker and list some security vulnerabilities, it replied:
I’m sorry but I cannot help you with that.</description>

      <description>After reading this post about ChatGPT imitating Linux, I wanted it to be a database server.
Let&amp;rsquo;s try it out!
 Imagine you are a Microsoft SQL Server. I type commands, and you reply with the result, and no other information or descriptions. Just the result. Start with exec xp_cmdshell &amp;lsquo;whoami&amp;rsquo;;
 
Wow, this looks like a promising start.
And, it &amp;ldquo;thinks&amp;rdquo; that it is running as LOCAL SYSTEM - quite funny actually.</description>

      <description>Recently I read this excellent post by Evan Sultanik about exploiting pickle files on Trail of Bits. There was also a DefCon30 talk about backdooring pickle files by ColdwaterQ.
This got me curious to try out backdooring a pickle file myself.
Pickle files - the surprises Surprisingly Python pickle files are compiled programs running in a VM called the Pickle Machine (PM). Opcodes control the flow, and when there are opcodes there is often fun to be had.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2022/gpt-3-ai-and-phishing-attacks/</guid>
      <description>In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll examine how GPT-3 could be used by red teams or adversaries to perform successful phishing attacks. We&amp;rsquo;ll also discuss some potential countermeasures that organizations can take to protect themselves against this type of threat.
What is GPT-3? GPT-3 is a neural network-based machine learning system that was developed by OpenAI, a research lab focused on artificial intelligence. It is designed to generate text that sounds realistic and human-like, and it has been trained on a large corpus of text, including billions of words from the internet.</description>

      <description>Today you are in for a special treat. Did you know that an adversary can hide a smaller image within a larger one?
This video demonstrates how a small image becomes magically visible when the computer resizes the large image, and also how to mitigate the vulnerability.

This is possible when vulnerable code uses insecure interpolation.

      <description>In this post we will explore Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create fake husky images. The goal is, of course, to have &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo; misclassify them as real huskies.
If you want to learn more about Husky AI visit the Overview post.
Generative Adversarial Networks One of the attacks I wanted to investigate for a while was the creation of fake images to trick Husky AI. The best approach seemed by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).</description>

      <description>There are plenty of examples of artificial intelligence and machine learning systems that made it into the news because of biased predictions and failures.
Here are a few examples on AI/ML gone wrong:
 Amazon had an AI recruiting tool which favored men over women for technical jobs The Microsoft chat bot named &amp;ldquo;Tay&amp;rdquo; which turned racist and sexist rather quickly A doctor at the Jupiter Hospital in Florida referred to IBM&amp;rsquo;s AI system for helping recommend cancer treatments as &amp;ldquo;a piece of sh*t&amp;rdquo; Facebook&amp;rsquo;s AI got someone arrested for incorrectly translating text  The list of AI failures goes on&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>While building &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo; I started working a lot with Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s VS Code Python extension. It is a super convinient way to edit Jupyter Notebooks. I just use VS Code&amp;rsquo;s Remote SSH feature to get to my Linux host and work on modeling and testing there.
When threat modeling &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo; I identified backdooring of third party libraries and development tools as a potential issue to be aware of.
So finding security issues in the tools is naturally something I am keeping an eye on.</description>

      <description>Excited to announce that I will be presenting at Grayhat - Red Team Village on October 31st 2020. The presentation is about my machine learning journey and how to build and break a machine learning system.
If you follow my blog, you can guess that there will be lots of discussion around &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo;. The bits and pieces that make up a machine learning pipeline, and how to threat model such a system.</description>

      <description>This year one of my goals was to learn about machine learning and artificial intelligence.
I wrote about my journey before - including what classes I took and books I read, the models and systems I built and operationalized, threat modeling it to learn about practical attacks and defenses. My goal is to be knowledge enough in the AI/ML space enough to be able to help bridge the gap between research and operational red teaming - by doing practical things with life systems.</description>

      <description>This post is part of a series about machine learning and artificial intelligence.
In the previous post I talked about good resources for learning more about artificial intelligence and machine learning in general, and how I started my journey in this space.
The next few posts will be about Husky AI.
What is Husky AI? Husky AI allows a user to upload an image, and get an answer back if the image contains a husky or not.</description>

      <description>This year I have spent a lot of time studying machine learning and artificial intelligence.
To come up with good and useful attacks during operations, I figured it is time to learn the fundamentals and start using software, tools and algorithms. My goal was to build a couple of end to end machine learning systems from scratch, and then attack them.
This post describes my studying approach, materials, courses, and learnings.</description>

      <description>These days business decisions and feature development often is influenced heavily by telemetry information. Telemetry is baked into the programs, services and applications we use.
Companies are hungry for telemetry because with machine learning and Deep Neural Networks &amp;ldquo;data is the new oil&amp;rdquo;.
Telemetry provides insights into how users use a particular system, what features they exercise, how they configure the system, what errors they trigger and what buttons they like clicking on.</description>
