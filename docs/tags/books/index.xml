      <description>Announcement After countless evenings and weekends in coffee shops, and multiple vacations with the laptop, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce that my first book has been published. It took 18 months from writing the first words (at Victrola Coffee Roasters on Capitol Hill by the way) to finishing this project just a few days ago.

Looking back its amazing how this all came together. The first intial draft had 100 pages, and in the end it ended up being 524 pages.</description>

      <description>Pass the Cookie made it into the latest 2600 magazine! Very excited about this!
I was just walking around Capitol Hill and stopped by Ada&amp;rsquo;s Technical Books on 15th Avenue - a great coffee shop with lots of technical books. Right after walking in to grab a cup of tea, I saw the latest Hacker Quarterly. A few months back I submitted an article about &amp;ldquo;Pass the Cookie&amp;rdquo;, so I had to check, and the article got indeed published!</description>
