      <description>One thing every red team should attempt early on and regularly is to perform some password spray testing across their organization to identify and help remediate usage of weak passwords.&#xA;In the past I have done this on Windows a lot, but now I built a simple version for it for Bash to run it also from a Mac.&#xA;Check it out: Bash Spray&#xA;Ideally, a script like bashspray.sh is integrated into your response pipelines, and SOC, Blue Team as well as account owner get notified - so they change their password right away, and any SOC investigation can be performed if necessary.</description>

      <title>Lyrebird - Hack the hacker (and take a picture)</title>

      <description>The idea for Lyrebird came from observing that sometimes when someone forgets lock their workstation, someone else might mess with their computer. Since I wanted to learn more on how to program a webcam and take pictures - I figured why not create a little tool that takes a screenshot and uses the webcam to take pictures of anyone that interacts with the computer while I&amp;rsquo;m gone.&#xA;The way this work is simple, start Lyrebird.</description>

      <description>KoiPhish is a simple yet beautiful relay proxy idea.&#xA;The idea for this little project goes back many years. Since I started learning Golang I figured it would be good exercise to finally go ahead an implement it. So, last December during the 35C3 (which is always inspiring congress) I wrote it up.&#xA;It relays requests a client makes to the KoiPish to the actual target and responses are sent back to the client.</description>
