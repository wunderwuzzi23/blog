      <description>After a bit of a delay my Flipper Zero finally arrived in the mail. If you are not familiar with Flipper Zero at all, check out the original Kickstarter page from a few years back.&#xA;This is what the package looks like after opening. It contains the device, a USB cable, a quick start manual (mostly pointing you to the Flipper Zero website), and a Flipper &amp;ldquo;Hack the planet&amp;rdquo; sticker.</description>

      <description>Until the Apple Airtag came out a few months ago I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really looked into the tag tracking market. Turns out there were already quite a lot of offerings available before Apple joined the market, most notably Tile.&#xA;However, I wanted to try out the Airtag and ended up ordering a few.&#xA;This post will explore three things:&#xA;Removing the speaker of my Airtag Using Browser APIs to scan for Airtags (if you don&amp;rsquo;t have an iPhone but someone tries to stalk you this might be handy) Explore data exfiltration via Airtags and Apple&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Find My&amp;rdquo; network By the way, when you order your Airtags online you can customize them.</description>
