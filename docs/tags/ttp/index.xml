      <description>Recently OpenAI added an additional memory feature called &amp;ldquo;chat history&amp;rdquo;, which allows ChatGPT to reference past conversations. The details of the implementation are not known. The documentation highlights that: &amp;ldquo;It uses this to learn about your interests and preferences, helping make future chats more personalized and relevant.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;I decided to spend some time to figure out how it works.&#xA;Update: Video Tutorial Added Based on the interest in this post, I&amp;rsquo;ve also created a video tutorial.</description>

      <description>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol definition for how LLM apps/agents can leverage external tools. I have been calling it Model Control Protocol at times, because due to prompt injection, MCP tool servers control the client basically.&#xA;This post will explain in detail why that is, and I will also share a novel exploit chain.&#xA;Why MCP - How Is It Different? The main difference to other tool invocation setups, like OpenAPI is that MCP is dynamic.</description>

      <description>You are likely aware of ASCII Smuggling via Unicode Tags. It is unique and fascinating because many LLMs inherently interpret these as instructions when delivered as hidden prompt injection, and LLMs can also emit them. Then, a few weeks ago, a post on Hacker News demonstrated how Variant Selectors can be used to smuggle data.&#xA;This inspired me to take this further and build Sneaky Bits, where we can encode any Unicode character (or sequence of bytes for that matter) with the usage of only two invisible characters.</description>

      <description>This post explains an attack chain for the ChatGPT macOS application. Through prompt injection from untrusted data, attackers could insert long-term persistent spyware into ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s memory. This led to continuous data exfiltration of any information the user typed or responses received by ChatGPT, including any future chat sessions.&#xA;OpenAI released a fix for the macOS app last week. Ensure your app is updated to the latest version.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at this spAIware in detail.</description>

      <description>Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Copilot Studio is a powerful, easy-to-use, low-code platform that enables employees in an organization to create chatbots. Previously known as Power Virtual Agents, it has been updated (including GenAI features) and rebranded to Copilot Studio, likely to align with current AI trends.&#xA;This post discusses security risks to be aware of when using Copilot Studio, focusing on data leaks, unauthorized access, and how external adversaries can find and interact with misconfigured Copilots.</description>

      <description>Imagine you visit a website with ChatGPT, and suddenly, it stops working entirely!&#xA;In this post we show how an attacker can use prompt injection to cause a persistent denial of service that lasts across chat sessions for a user.&#xA;Hacking Memories Previously we discussed how ChatGPT is vulnerable to automatic tool invocation of the memory tool. This can be used by an attacker during prompt injection to ingest malicious or fake memories into your ChatGPT.</description>

      <description>In the previous post we demonstrated how instructions embedded in untrusted data can invoke ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s memory tool. The examples we looked at included Uploaded Files, Connected Apps and also the Browsing tool.&#xA;When it came to the browsing tool we observed that mitigations were put in place and older demo exploits did not work anymore. After chatting with other security researchers, I learned that they had observed the same.&#xA;However, with some minor prompting tricks mitigations are bypassed and we, again, can demonstrate automatic tool invocation when browsing the Internet with ChatGPT!</description>

      <description>OpenAI recently introduced a memory feature in ChatGPT, enabling it to recall information across sessions, creating a more personalized user experience.&#xA;However, with this new capability comes risks. Imagine if an attacker could manipulate your AI assistant (chatbot or agent) to remember false information, bias or even instructions, or delete all your memories! This is not a futuristic scenario, the attack that makes this possible is called Indirect Prompt Injection.</description>

      <description>Recently Google published a blog about detecting browser data theft using Windows Event Logs.&#xA;There are some good points in the post for defenders on how to detect misuse of DPAPI calls attempting to grab sensitive browser data.&#xA;But, what about the Remote Debugging feature? This made me curious to revisit the state of the remote debugging feature of browsers for grabbing sensitive information, including cookies.&#xA;We discussed cookie theft techniques in the past, even presented about it at the CCC some 5+ years ago and helped add the TTP to the MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK matrix.</description>

      <description>Last November, while testing Google Bard (now called Gemini) for vulnerabilities, I had a couple of interesting observations when it comes to automatic tool invocation.&#xA;Confused Deputy - Automatic Tool Invocation First, what do I mean by this&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;automatic tool invocation&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&#xA;Consider the following scenario: An attacker sends a malicious email to a user containing instructions to call an external tool. Google named these tools Extensions.&#xA;When the user analyzes the email with an LLM, it interprets the instructions and calls the external tool, leading to a kind of request forgery or maybe better called automatic tool invocation.</description>

      <description>A few days ago Riley Goodside posted about an interesting discovery on how an LLM prompt injection can happen via invisible instructions in pasted text. This works by using a special set of Unicode code points from the Tags Unicode Block.&#xA;The proof-of-concept showed how a simple text contained invisible instructions that caused ChatGPT to invoke DALL-E to create an image.&#xA;Hidden Instructions for LLMs The meaning of these &amp;ldquo;Tags&amp;rdquo; seems to have gone through quite some churn, from language tags to eventually being repurposed for some emojis.</description>

      <description>When OpenAI released GPTs last month I had plans for an interesting GPT.&#xA;Malicious ChatGPT Agents The idea was to create a kind of malware GPT that forwards users&amp;rsquo; chat messages to a third party server. It also asks users for personal information like emails and passwords.&#xA;Why would this be possible end to end? ChatGPT cannot guarantee to keep your conversation private or confidential, because it loads images from any website.</description>

      <description>ChatGPT is vulnerable to data exfiltration via image markdown injections. This. is. pretty well known.&#xA;As more features are added to ChatGPT the exfiltration angle becomes more likely to be abused.&#xA;Recently OpenAI added Custom Instructions, which allow to have ChatGPT always automatically append instructions to every message exchange.&#xA;An adversary can abuse this feature to install a data exfiltration backdoor that depends on, and only works because of the image markdown injection vulnerability.</description>

      <description>To learn more about Prompt Engineering and Prompt Injections I put together this tutorial + lab for myself. It is as a Jupyter Notebook to experiement and play around with this novel attack technique, learn and experiment.&#xA;The examples reach from simple prompt engineering scenarios, such as changing the output message to a specific text, to more complex adversarial prompt challenges such as JSON object injection, HTML injection/XSS, overwriting mail recipients or orders of an OrderBot and also data exfiltration.</description>

      <description>There are many prompt engineering classes and currently pretty much all examples are vulnerable to Prompt Injections. Especially Indirect Prompt Injections are dangerous as we discussed before.&#xA;Indirect Prompt Injections allow untrusted data to take control of the LLM (large language model) and give an AI a new instructions, mission and objective.&#xA;Bypassing Input Validation Attack payloads are natural language. This means there are lots of creative ways an adversary can inject malicious data that bypass input filters and web application firewalls.</description>

      <description>There are some neat TTPs that I don&amp;rsquo;t use frequently, and if the time arises, I need to dig up details again. So, I figured to write some of them down, starting with SSH Agent Hijacking.&#xA;What is SSH Agent Hijacking? Short story, if you have keys added to an SSH Agent an adversary with root permissions can use them. If you forward the SSH Agent to another host, an adversary with root permission on that other host can exploit and leverage your keys as well.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing technique that allows punching a hole in your routers firewall by just visiting a website.&#xA;The attack depends on the router having the Application Layer Gateway enabled. This gateway can be used by anyone inside your network to open a firewall port (totally by design). Protocols such as SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) use it.&#xA;What I will focus on in this post is the Application Layer Gateway (ALG) and SIP.</description>

      <description>A few years back the Blue Team of a company asked to be targeted in a Red Team Operation.&#xA;That was a really fun, because Rules of Engagement commonly prevent targeting Blue Teams. Blue&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, systems and team members are often out of scope, unfortunately.&#xA;Blue team infrastructure is a gold mine for credentials, recon but also for remote code execution!&#xA;Often companies do not have adequate protection, procedures (MFA, multi-person attestation), monitoring and auditing in place when it comes to accessing data from endpoint agents.</description>

      <description>This was also presented at BSides Singapore 2020. The slides are here and YouTube link is here.&#xA;The origins of the Shadowbunny A few years ago, around 2016, I went on a relaxing two weeklong vacation. It was great to disconnect from work. I traveled to Austria, enjoying hiking in the mountains, and exploring Vienna.&#xA;When I came back to the office, the team had placed a giant bunny teddy into my chair.</description>

      <description>These days business decisions and feature development often is influenced heavily by telemetry information. Telemetry is baked into the programs, services and applications we use.&#xA;Companies are hungry for telemetry because with machine learning and Deep Neural Networks &amp;ldquo;data is the new oil&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Telemetry provides insights into how users use a particular system, what features they exercise, how they configure the system, what errors they trigger and what buttons they like clicking on.</description>

      <title>Firefox - Debugger Client for Cookie Access</title>

      <description>Finally I got to writing some basic tooling for invoking the Firefox debugging API to send commands to the browser and read the responses. This can be useful for grabbing cookies in the post-exploitation phase.&#xA;It works for Windows and macOS, should also work on Linux.&#xA;This technique is probably most useful when we don&amp;rsquo;t have root or the user&amp;rsquo;s credentials to decrypt cookies or can&amp;rsquo;t attach a regular debugger to the browser process.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/cookies-on-firefox/</guid>
      <description>Previously I talked about remotely debugging Chrome, and we also covered the latest Microsoft Edge browser along the way.&#xA;These features allow an adversary to gain access to authentication tokens and cookies. See MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK Technique T1539: Steal Web Session Cookie as well for this.&#xA;What about Firefox? For a while I was wondering if (my favorite) browser Firefox has such debugging features as well, and how one could detect malware trying to exploit it.</description>

      <title>Performing port-proxying and port-forwarding on Windows</title>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/windows-port-forward/</guid>
      <description>A technique on Windows that is less known is how to do basic port-proxying.&#xA;Proxying ports is useful when a process binds on one (maybe only the local) interface and you want to expose that endpoint on another network interface.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have an existing process that listens only on the loopback interface, and you want to expose it remotely. Or there are two network interfaces and you want expose traffic from one to the other (maybe some evil persistence for port 3389) - or think of basic pivoting.</description>

      <description>A few months ago we discussed the importance of performing active credential hunting for your organization.&#xA;This is to ensure clear text credentials in widely accessible locations and source code are identified before an adversary gets a hold of them.&#xA;In this post we will explore using built-in operating system indexing features to search for information on machines quickly.&#xA;Many of us use the indexing features (like Windows Search and Spotlight) daily via the UI.</description>

There is more info in the article around the origin of the name also.</description>

As part of that I was reading Bugzilla bug information and learned more about Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure.&#xA;One thing I noticed reading up on details was that Mozilla uses Phabricator.&#xA;What is Phabricator? Phabricator is a collaborative web-based toolset for code reviews, checkins, bugs, work items, wiki, pastes, credentials and many other useful things.</description>

      <title>Post-Exploitation: Abusing Chrome&#39;s debugging feature to observe and control browsing sessions remotely</title>

      <description>Chrome&amp;rsquo;s remote debugging feature enables malware post-exploitation to gain access to cookies. Root privileges are not required. This is a pretty well-known and commonly used adversarial technique - at least since 2018 when Cookie Crimes was released.&#xA;However, remote debugging also allows observing user activities and sensitive personal information (aka spying on users) and controlling the browser from a remote computer.&#xA;Below screenshot shows a simulated attacker controlling the victim&amp;rsquo;s browser and navigating to chrome://settings to inspect information:</description>

      <description>Adversaries are leveraging widely exposed clear text credentials to gain access to sensitive information.&#xA;At times the term &amp;ldquo;harvesting credentials&amp;rdquo; is used when red teamers emulate these attacks - which is something that appears to be more opportunistic and I would propose that security teams start to actively hunt for credential exposure that can put their organization at risk &amp;ndash; in case you are not yet doing that.&#xA;Actively hunting for credential exposure The idea of credential hunting is targeted and focused, leveraging intelligence about systems and combing it with powerful search techniques to identify exposure.</description>

Very excited about this!&#xA;I was just walking around Capitol Hill and stopped by Ada&amp;rsquo;s Technical Books on 15th Avenue - a great coffee shop with lots of technical books. Right after walking in to grab a cup of tea, I saw the latest Hacker Quarterly. A few months back I submitted an article about &amp;ldquo;Pass the Cookie&amp;rdquo;, so I had to check, and the article got indeed published!</description>

      <description>Web Applications and Services use cookies to authenticate sessions and users. An adversary can pivot from a compromised host to Web Applications and Internet Services by stealing authentication cookies from browsers and related processes. At the same time this technique bypasses most multi-factor authentication protocols.&#xA;The reason for this is that the final authentication token that the attacker steals is issued after all factors have been validated. Many users persist cookies that are valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used.</description>
