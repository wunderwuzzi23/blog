      <description>This year I spent a lot of time reviewing, exploiting and working with vendors to fix vulnerabilities in agentic AI systems.&#xA;As a result, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce the Month of AI Bugs 2025!&#xA;Goal Of The Initiative The main purpose of the Month of AI Bugs is to raise awareness about novel security vulnerabilities in agentic systems, primarily focusing on AI coding agents. Posts will cover both simple and advanced, sometimes even mind-boggling exploits.</description>

      <description>Today we are going to discuss how real-world tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) apply to computer-use systems, specifically, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at ClickFix attacks. This demo was part of my presentation at the SAGAI Workshop on May 15th, 2025 in San Francisco.&#xA;It was a great workshop, with tons of interesting insights and discussions.&#xA;So, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about ClickFix, and how it applies to AI systems!&#xA;What is ClickFix? ClickFix is a social engineering technique that is being used by adversaries.</description>
