      <description>In this 25 minute video I&amp;rsquo;m explaining the foundations of Web Application Security.&#xA;The video covers the basic building blocks of web applications, such as HTML, HTTP, JavaScript and Cookies. Furthermore core web applications security concepts such as the Same-Origin Policy are discussed in detail.&#xA;The goal is to provide foundational knowledge to help grasp security vulnerabilities, such as XSS, CSRF, SQLi, tab-nabbing, etc. later on.&#xA;In the past I have trained and presented content like this to thousands of engineers at large organizations and cloud providers, hence its quite optimized for best learning and comprehension outcome.</description>
