      <description>Next week (on March, 9th 2021) I will be speaking at the Hong Kong Information Security Summit 2021.
歡迎, 你好!

I was invited to share my thoughts around protecting the modern (and remote) workplace. Of course, my talk is addressing this topic from a red teaming point of view. Conference details are here.
The adversary will come to your house The name of the talk is &amp;ldquo;Red Team Strategies for Helping Protect the Modern Workplace&amp;rdquo; which might seem less creative, but there is some (hopefullly) good and interesting information in my talk.</description>
