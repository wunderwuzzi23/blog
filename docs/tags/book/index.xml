      <description>Throughout my career I have been fascinated with quality assurance and testing, especially security testing and red teaming. One discussion that comes up frequently is how to measure the maturity of such programs and processes.&#xA;My answer is straight forward as there are already existing frameworks that can be leveraged, adjusted and borrowed from to fit the needs of offensive security programs.&#xA;You are likely familiar or have at least heard of the Capability Maturity Model Integration from Carnegie Mellon University.</description>

      <description>Last month I did some research on Firefox, specifically I was learning more about it&amp;rsquo;s remote debugging features. As part of that I was reading Bugzilla bug information and learned more about Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure.&#xA;One thing I noticed reading up on details was that Mozilla uses Phabricator.&#xA;What is Phabricator? Phabricator is a collaborative web-based toolset for code reviews, checkins, bugs, work items, wiki, pastes, credentials and many other useful things.</description>

      <title>Post-Exploitation: Abusing Chrome&#39;s debugging feature to observe and control browsing sessions remotely</title>

      <description>Chrome&amp;rsquo;s remote debugging feature enables malware post-exploitation to gain access to cookies. Root privileges are not required. This is a pretty well-known and commonly used adversarial technique - at least since 2018 when Cookie Crimes was released.&#xA;However, remote debugging also allows observing user activities and sensitive personal information (aka spying on users) and controlling the browser from a remote computer.&#xA;Below screenshot shows a simulated attacker controlling the victim&amp;rsquo;s browser and navigating to chrome://settings to inspect information:</description>

      <title>Hunting for credentials and building a credential type reference catalog</title>

      <description>Adversaries are leveraging widely exposed clear text credentials to gain access to sensitive information.&#xA;At times the term &amp;ldquo;harvesting credentials&amp;rdquo; is used when red teamers emulate these attacks - which is something that appears to be more opportunistic and I would propose that security teams start to actively hunt for credential exposure that can put their organization at risk &amp;ndash; in case you are not yet doing that.&#xA;Actively hunting for credential exposure The idea of credential hunting is targeted and focused, leveraging intelligence about systems and combing it with powerful search techniques to identify exposure.</description>

      <title>Attack Graphs - How to create and present them</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/conceptual-attack-graphs/</link>

      <description>Conceptual Attack Graphs One question that I have gotten a few times about &amp;ldquo;Cybersecurity Attacks - Red Team Strategies&amp;rdquo; is around the conceptual attack graphs in &amp;ldquo;Chapter 3, Measuring an Offensive Security Program&amp;rdquo;. Specifically, how I create them.&#xA;In this post I will briefly go over some of the reasons for creating them, and also how I create them and share a template for others to use and adjust.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m not a graphic designer, so I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are better ways of doing this.</description>
