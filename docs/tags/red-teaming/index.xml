      <description>This post is part of a series about machine learning and artificial intelligence.&#xA;Adversaries often leverage supply chain attacks to gain footholds. In machine learning model deserialization issues are a significant threat, and detecting them is crucial, as they can lead to arbitrary code execution. We explored this attack with Python Pickle files in the past.&#xA;In this post we are covering backdooring the original Keras Husky AI model from the Machine Learning Attack Series, and afterwards we investigate tooling to detect the backdoor.</description>
