      <title>Video: Understanding Image Scaling Attacks</title>

      <description>Today you are in for a special treat. Did you know that an adversary can hide a smaller image within a larger one?&#xA;This video demonstrates how a small image becomes magically visible when the computer resizes the large image, and also how to mitigate the vulnerability.&#xA;This is possible when vulnerable code uses insecure interpolation.&#xA;If you like this one check out the overall Machine Learning Attack Series.&#xA;Credit for original research, Erwing Quiring, et al.</description>

      <description>Tabnabbing is a web application security vulnerability that can be used to perform phishing attacks, so its important to be aware of it as a developer and penetration tester.&#xA;It is easy to mitigate and in this short video we cover both attacks and mitigations.&#xA;Thanks for reading and happy hacking!&#xA;@wunderwuzzi23</description>

      <title>Video: Web Application Security Fundamentals</title>

      <description>In this 25 minute video I&amp;rsquo;m explaining the foundations of Web Application Security.&#xA;The video covers the basic building blocks of web applications, such as HTML, HTTP, JavaScript and Cookies. Furthermore core web applications security concepts such as the Same-Origin Policy are discussed in detail.&#xA;The goal is to provide foundational knowledge to help grasp security vulnerabilities, such as XSS, CSRF, SQLi, tab-nabbing, etc. later on.&#xA;In the past I have trained and presented content like this to thousands of engineers at large organizations and cloud providers, hence its quite optimized for best learning and comprehension outcome.</description>

      <title>Race conditions when applying ACLs</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/applying-acls-and-race-conditions/</link>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m gonna talk about a class of application security issues I ran across a few times over the years. In particular, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss race conditions when it comes to files with sensitive content and permissions.&#xA;Race conditions can allow an adversary to gain access to sensitive information on machines. Assume a system creates a file that contains sensitive information and afterwards applies permissions to lockdown that file.&#xA;Understanding the race condition Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a practical example seen in the wild a few times.</description>
