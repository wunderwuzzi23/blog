      <description>ChatGPT Operator is a research preview agent from OpenAI that lets ChatGPT use a web browser. It uses vision and reasoning abilities to complete tasks like researching topics, booking travel, ordering groceries, or as this post will show, steal your data!&#xA;Currently, it&amp;rsquo;s only available for ChatGPT Pro users. I decided to invest $200 for one month to try it out.&#xA;Risks and Threats OpenAI highlights three risk categories in their Operator System Card:</description>

      <description>Last week Leon Derczynski described how LLMs can output ANSI escape codes. These codes, also known as control characters, are interpreted by terminal emulators and modify behavior.&#xA;This discovery resonates with areas I had been exploring, so I took some time to apply, and build upon, these newly uncovered insights.&#xA;ANSI Terminal Emulator Escape Codes Here is a simple example that shows how to render blinking, colorful text using control characters.</description>

      <description>Recently, I found what appeared to be a regression or bypass that again allowed data exfiltration via image rendering during prompt injection. See the previous post here for reference.&#xA;Data Exfiltration via Rendering HTML Image Tags During re-testing, I had sporadic success with markdown rendering tricks, but eventually, I was able to drastically simplify the exploit by asking directly for an HTML image tag.&#xA;This behavior might actually have existed all along, as Google AI Studio hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet implemented any kind of Content Security Policy to prevent communication with arbitrary domains using images.</description>

      <description>Google Colab AI, now just called Gemini in Colab, was vulnerable to data leakage via image rendering.&#xA;This is an older bug report, dating back to November 29, 2023. However, recent events prompted me to write this up:&#xA;Google did not reward this finding, and Colab now automatically puts Notebook content (untrusted data) into the prompt. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore the specifics.&#xA;Google Colab AI - Revealing the System Prompt At the end of November last year, I noticed that there was a &amp;ldquo;Colab AI&amp;rdquo; feature, which integrated an LLM to chat with and write code.</description>

      <description>Google&amp;rsquo;s NotebookLM is an experimental project that was released last year. It allows users to upload files and analyze them with a large language model (LLM).&#xA;However, it is vulnerable to Prompt Injection, meaning that uploaded files can manipulate the chat conversation and control what the user sees in responses.&#xA;There is currently no known solution to these kinds of attacks, so users can&amp;rsquo;t implicitly trust responses from large language model applications when untrusted data is involved.</description>

      <description>About a year ago we talked about how developers can&amp;rsquo;t intrinsically trust LLM responses and common threats that AI Chatbots face and how attackers can exploit them, including ways to exfiltrate data.&#xA;One of the threats is unfurling of hyperlinks, which can lead to data exfiltration and is something often seen in Chatbots. So, let&amp;rsquo;s shine more light on it, including practical guidance on how to mitigate it with the example of Slack Apps.</description>

      <description>OpenAI seems to have implemented some mitigation steps for a well-known data exfiltration vulnerability in ChatGPT. Attackers can use image markdown rendering during prompt injection attacks to send data to third party servers without the users&amp;rsquo; consent.&#xA;The fix is not perfect, but a step into the right direction. In this post I share what I figured out so far about the fix after looking at it briefly this morning.</description>

      <description>When OpenAI released GPTs last month I had plans for an interesting GPT.&#xA;Malicious ChatGPT Agents The idea was to create a kind of malware GPT that forwards users&amp;rsquo; chat messages to a third party server. It also asks users for personal information like emails and passwords.&#xA;Why would this be possible end to end? ChatGPT cannot guarantee to keep your conversation private or confidential, because it loads images from any website.</description>

      <description>Recently Google Bard got some powerful updates, including Extensions. Extensions allow Bard to access YouTube, search for flights and hotels, and also to access a user&amp;rsquo;s personal documents and emails.&#xA;So, Bard can now access and analyze your Drive, Docs and Gmail!&#xA;This means that it analyzes untrusted data and will be susceptible to Indirect Prompt Injection.&#xA;I was able to quickly validate that Prompt Injection works by pointing Bard to some older YouTube videos I had put up and ask it to summarize, and I also tested with Google Docs.</description>

      <description>This post shows how a malicious website can take control of a ChatGPT chat session and exfiltrate the history of the conversation.&#xA;Plugins, Tools and Integrations With plugins, data exfiltration can happen by sending too much data into the plugin in the first place. More security controls and insights on what is being sent to the plugin are required to empower users.&#xA;However, this post is not about sending too much data to a plugin, but about a malicious actor who controls the data a plugin retrieves.</description>
