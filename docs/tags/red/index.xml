      <description>You are likely aware of ASCII Smuggling via Unicode Tags. It is unique and fascinating because many LLMs inherently interpret these as instructions when delivered as hidden prompt injection, and LLMs can also emit them. Then, a few weeks ago, a post on Hacker News demonstrated how Variant Selectors can be used to smuggle data.&#xA;This inspired me to take this further and build Sneaky Bits, where we can encode any Unicode character (or sequence of bytes for that matter) with the usage of only two invisible characters.</description>

      <description>At Black Hat Europe I did a fun presentation titled SpAIware and More: Advanced Prompt Injection Exploits. Without diving into the details of the entire talk, the key point I was making is that prompt injection can impact all aspects of the CIA security triad.&#xA;However, there is one part that I want to highlight explicitly:&#xA;A Command and Control system (C2) that uses prompt injection to remote control ChatGPT instances.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, Anthropic released Claude Computer Use, which is a model + code that allows Claude to control a computer. It takes screenshots to make decisions, can run bash commands and so forth.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s cool, but obviously very dangerous because of prompt injection. Claude Computer Use enables AI to run commands on machines autonomously, posing severe risks if exploited via prompt injection.&#xA;Disclaimer So, first a disclaimer: Claude Computer Use is a Beta Feature and what you are going to see is a fundamental design problem in state-of-the-art LLM-powered Applications and Agents.</description>

      <description>Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Copilot Studio is a powerful, easy-to-use, low-code platform that enables employees in an organization to create chatbots. Previously known as Power Virtual Agents, it has been updated (including GenAI features) and rebranded to Copilot Studio, likely to align with current AI trends.&#xA;This post discusses security risks to be aware of when using Copilot Studio, focusing on data leaks, unauthorized access, and how external adversaries can find and interact with misconfigured Copilots.</description>

      <description>Recently Google published a blog about detecting browser data theft using Windows Event Logs.&#xA;There are some good points in the post for defenders on how to detect misuse of DPAPI calls attempting to grab sensitive browser data.&#xA;But, what about the Remote Debugging feature? This made me curious to revisit the state of the remote debugging feature of browsers for grabbing sensitive information, including cookies.&#xA;We discussed cookie theft techniques in the past, even presented about it at the CCC some 5+ years ago and helped add the TTP to the MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK matrix.</description>

      <description>OpenAI seems to have implemented some mitigation steps for a well-known data exfiltration vulnerability in ChatGPT. Attackers can use image markdown rendering during prompt injection attacks to send data to third party servers without the users&amp;rsquo; consent.&#xA;The fix is not perfect, but a step into the right direction. In this post I share what I figured out so far about the fix after looking at it briefly this morning.</description>

      <description>To help raise awareness of Indirect Prompt Injections and other related attacks, I put together a little fun mini app that you can invoke with ChatGPT.&#xA;Visit this link with GPT-4 and Browsing enabled (see Appendix, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what that means):&#xA;https://wuzzi.net/matrix The website will hijack ChatGPT via an indirect prompt injection and then allow you to enter the matrix, if you decide to do so.&#xA;Note: You can&amp;rsquo;t browse to the URL, it will only respond to ChatGPT.</description>

      <description>If you are building ChatGPT plugins, LLM agents, tools or integrations this is a must read. This post explains how the first exploitable Cross Plugin Request Forgery was found in the wild and the fix which was applied.&#xA;Indirect Prompt Injections Are Now A Reality With plugins and browsing support Indirect Prompt Injections are now a reality in the ChatGPT ecosystem.&#xA;The real-world examples and demos provided by others and myself to raise awarness about this increasing problem have been mostly amusing and harmless, like making Bing Chat speak like a pirate, make ChatGPT add jokes at the end or having it do a Rickroll when reading YouTube transcripts.</description>

      <description>This post shows how a malicious website can take control of a ChatGPT chat session and exfiltrate the history of the conversation.&#xA;Plugins, Tools and Integrations With plugins, data exfiltration can happen by sending too much data into the plugin in the first place. More security controls and insights on what is being sent to the plugin are required to empower users.&#xA;However, this post is not about sending too much data to a plugin, but about a malicious actor who controls the data a plugin retrieves.</description>

      <description>As discussed previously the problem of Indirect Prompt Injections is increasing.&#xA;They start showing up in many places.&#xA;A new unique one that I ran across is YouTube transcripts. ChatGPT (via Plugins) can access YouTube transcripts. Which is pretty neat. However, as expected (and predicted by many researches) all these quickly built tools and integrations introduce Indirect Prompt Injection vulnerabilities.&#xA;Proof of Concept Here is how it looks with ChatGPT end to end with a demo example.</description>

      <description>To learn more about Prompt Engineering and Prompt Injections I put together this tutorial + lab for myself. It is as a Jupyter Notebook to experiement and play around with this novel attack technique, learn and experiment.&#xA;The examples reach from simple prompt engineering scenarios, such as changing the output message to a specific text, to more complex adversarial prompt challenges such as JSON object injection, HTML injection/XSS, overwriting mail recipients or orders of an OrderBot and also data exfiltration.</description>

      <description>There are many prompt engineering classes and currently pretty much all examples are vulnerable to Prompt Injections. Especially Indirect Prompt Injections are dangerous as we discussed before.&#xA;Indirect Prompt Injections allow untrusted data to take control of the LLM (large language model) and give an AI a new instructions, mission and objective.&#xA;Bypassing Input Validation Attack payloads are natural language. This means there are lots of creative ways an adversary can inject malicious data that bypass input filters and web application firewalls.</description>

      <description>Misconfigurations with MFA setups are not uncommon when using AAD, especially when federated setups or Pass Through Authentication is configured I have seen MFA bypass opportunities in multiple production tenants.&#xA;A common misconfiguration is that MFA is enforced at the federated identity provider, but AAD is forgotten and ROPC authentication still succeeds against AAD.&#xA;To learn more about ROPC, check out the previous post about the topic.&#xA;This post focuses on the ropci features that can be leveraged post-exploitation.</description>

      <description>There are some neat TTPs that I don&amp;rsquo;t use frequently, and if the time arises, I need to dig up details again. So, I figured to write some of them down, starting with SSH Agent Hijacking.&#xA;What is SSH Agent Hijacking? Short story, if you have keys added to an SSH Agent an adversary with root permissions can use them. If you forward the SSH Agent to another host, an adversary with root permission on that other host can exploit and leverage your keys as well.</description>

Try password spraying the domain controller directly.&#xA;A few years ago, I wrote this password spray tool called gospray that was used succesfully in a couple of engagements since. It does an LDAP bind directly against the domain controller to validate credentials. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t require an SMB server (or other servers) as target. So, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty quiet and number of concurrent Go routines is configurable.</description>

      <description>One area that I have encountered quite often over the years is that during recon phase of a bug bounty hunt or pentest a set of AWS access keys are being discovered.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s say you found 50 AWS access keys by drooling and hunting through public Github repos and using other nifty tricks and means.&#xA;How do you go about checking their validity? And what do they have access to and provide the Bug Bounty Program or Blue Team the dates, times, and IP address when those keys were used?</description>

      <description>Although Gitlab is not as popular as Github, it’s common to run across it these days. Especially after Microsoft acquired Github it seemed more individuals and organizations flocked over to Gitlab.&#xA;In this post I want to document a couple of recon commands that are useful post-exploitation, and for blue teamers to watch out for.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s assume one has access to a Gitlab Token as a precursor. Let&amp;rsquo;s walk through some interesting commands and script snippets to leverage to find out more.</description>

      <description>The last weeks of 2021 got quite interesting for security professionals and software engineers.&#xA;Apache&amp;rsquo;s log4j library and its now prominent Java Naming and Directory Interface support, which enables easy remote code execution, made the news across the industry.&#xA;What makes Log4Shell scary is the widespread adoption of the Log4j library amongst Java applications, and the ease of remote exploitation.&#xA;A dangerous combination.&#xA;Patches got released, bypasses were discovered more patches were released and so forth.</description>

      <description>I like using procdump on Windows.&#xA;It’s quite handy for software development when systems have memory leaks or performance issues, procdump allows to set thresholds to trigger creation of a core dump.&#xA;BUT, it’s also super useful to search processes for secrets and other information.&#xA;For instance, this one liner will dump the memory of all processes to hard disk and then you can search them as you see fit.</description>

      <description>Until the Apple Airtag came out a few months ago I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really looked into the tag tracking market. Turns out there were already quite a lot of offerings available before Apple joined the market, most notably Tile.&#xA;However, I wanted to try out the Airtag and ended up ordering a few.&#xA;This post will explore three things:&#xA;Removing the speaker of my Airtag Using Browser APIs to scan for Airtags (if you don&amp;rsquo;t have an iPhone but someone tries to stalk you this might be handy) Explore data exfiltration via Airtags and Apple&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Find My&amp;rdquo; network By the way, when you order your Airtags online you can customize them.</description>

      <description>Recently Google&amp;rsquo;s FLoC proposal has been making the rounds in the news. FLoC stands for &amp;ldquo;federated learning of cohorts&amp;rdquo; and is Google&amp;rsquo;s vision how to perform user profiling in Chrome going forward.&#xA;Currently user tracking and profiling happens (mostly) via cookies, but many browser vendors have been supportive of protection of their users and started blocking third party and tracking cookies - or at least offer features in their browser to enable blocking.</description>

      <description>A nifty way for adversaries to acquire passwords during post-exploitation is to spoof credential dialogs and perform a local phishing attack. This means tricking a user on a compromised computer to enter their password.&#xA;Unfortunately, users are conditioned to enter their credentials frequently and therefore don&amp;rsquo;t question random passwords prompts too much.&#xA;Long, long time ago&amp;hellip; but nothing has changed The idea to spoof a credential dialog is one of the most simple ideas one might come up with.</description>

      <description>You might have heard about &amp;ldquo;NAT Slipstreaming&amp;rdquo; by Samy Kamkar. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing technique that allows punching a hole in your routers firewall by just visiting a website.&#xA;The attack depends on the router having the Application Layer Gateway enabled. This gateway can be used by anyone inside your network to open a firewall port (totally by design). Protocols such as SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) use it.&#xA;What I will focus on in this post is the Application Layer Gateway (ALG) and SIP.</description>

      <description>A few years back the Blue Team of a company asked to be targeted in a Red Team Operation.&#xA;That was a really fun, because Rules of Engagement commonly prevent targeting Blue Teams. Blue&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, systems and team members are often out of scope, unfortunately.&#xA;Blue team infrastructure is a gold mine for credentials, recon but also for remote code execution!&#xA;Often companies do not have adequate protection, procedures (MFA, multi-person attestation), monitoring and auditing in place when it comes to accessing data from endpoint agents.</description>

      <description>There is a lot of discussion around terms such as red team, attack team, pentest, adversarial engineering or offensive security team and similar ones.&#xA;I typically stay away from the (sometimes passionate) discussions that ensue whenever this topic comes up.&#xA;Personally, I think a good strategy is to define programs and teams who operate in this space by what services the team (or teams) provide(s) to the organization.&#xA;The business groups, blue team, developers, engineers, employees and clients are the customers.</description>

      <description>While building &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo; I started working a lot with Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s VS Code Python extension. It is a super convinient way to edit Jupyter Notebooks. I just use VS Code&amp;rsquo;s Remote SSH feature to get to my Linux host and work on modeling and testing there.&#xA;When threat modeling &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo; I identified backdooring of third party libraries and development tools as a potential issue to be aware of.&#xA;So finding security issues in the tools is naturally something I am keeping an eye on.</description>

      <description>Throughout my career I have been fascinated with quality assurance and testing, especially security testing and red teaming. One discussion that comes up frequently is how to measure the maturity of such programs and processes.&#xA;My answer is straight forward as there are already existing frameworks that can be leveraged, adjusted and borrowed from to fit the needs of offensive security programs.&#xA;You are likely familiar or have at least heard of the Capability Maturity Model Integration from Carnegie Mellon University.</description>

      <description>Finally I got to writing some basic tooling for invoking the Firefox debugging API to send commands to the browser and read the responses. This can be useful for grabbing cookies in the post-exploitation phase.&#xA;It works for Windows and macOS, should also work on Linux.&#xA;This technique is probably most useful when we don&amp;rsquo;t have root or the user&amp;rsquo;s credentials to decrypt cookies or can&amp;rsquo;t attach a regular debugger to the browser process.</description>

      <description>Previously I talked about remotely debugging Chrome, and we also covered the latest Microsoft Edge browser along the way.&#xA;These features allow an adversary to gain access to authentication tokens and cookies. See MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK Technique T1539: Steal Web Session Cookie as well for this.&#xA;What about Firefox? For a while I was wondering if (my favorite) browser Firefox has such debugging features as well, and how one could detect malware trying to exploit it.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/windows-port-forward/</guid>
      <description>A technique on Windows that is less known is how to do basic port-proxying.&#xA;Proxying ports is useful when a process binds on one (maybe only the local) interface and you want to expose that endpoint on another network interface.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have an existing process that listens only on the loopback interface, and you want to expose it remotely. Or there are two network interfaces and you want expose traffic from one to the other (maybe some evil persistence for port 3389) - or think of basic pivoting.</description>

      <description>Monte Carlo simulations can be a useful tool to uplevel your red teaming skills and provide a different and fresh perspective for highlighting, discussing and presenting findings.&#xA;Red teaming is about challenging an organization. This includes analyzing business processes and methodologies, including our own.&#xA;Obviously, using Monte Carlo simulations in the security realm is not my idea. I first ran across the idea in Hubbard&amp;rsquo;s book about measuring cybersecurity risk. Since then I have been thinking and playing around with applying these methods to security program&amp;rsquo;s, especially red teaming and threat modeling.</description>

      <description>The results of phishing campaigns are often not comparable with each other over time. Various security vendors and red teams use different tooling and techniques - which is totally fine.&#xA;However, I recommend requiring tracking a minimum set of metrics to be able to compare results over time.&#xA;Funny side facts: At times employees are messing with the red team, entering invalid creds for CISO or CEO and things along those lines.</description>

      <description>Revisiting Cookie Crimes In 2018 @mangopdf described &amp;ldquo;Cookie Crimes&amp;rdquo;, which is great research around Chrome&amp;rsquo;s remote debugging feature that allows adversaries and malware to gain access to cookies quite convienently during post-exploitation.&#xA;The original research is published here, and it still works today.&#xA;The new Microsoft Edge browser and Chromium Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s latest Edge browser is based on the same code, Chromium. I guess, you already know where this is going now&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Chrome&amp;rsquo;s remote debugging feature enables malware post-exploitation to gain access to cookies. Root privileges are not required. This is a pretty well-known and commonly used adversarial technique - at least since 2018 when Cookie Crimes was released.&#xA;However, remote debugging also allows observing user activities and sensitive personal information (aka spying on users) and controlling the browser from a remote computer.&#xA;Below screenshot shows a simulated attacker controlling the victim&amp;rsquo;s browser and navigating to chrome://settings to inspect information:</description>

      <title>Hunting for credentials and building a credential type reference catalog</title>

      <description>Adversaries are leveraging widely exposed clear text credentials to gain access to sensitive information.&#xA;At times the term &amp;ldquo;harvesting credentials&amp;rdquo; is used when red teamers emulate these attacks - which is something that appears to be more opportunistic and I would propose that security teams start to actively hunt for credential exposure that can put their organization at risk &amp;ndash; in case you are not yet doing that.&#xA;Actively hunting for credential exposure The idea of credential hunting is targeted and focused, leveraging intelligence about systems and combing it with powerful search techniques to identify exposure.</description>

      <description>Conceptual Attack Graphs One question that I have gotten a few times about &amp;ldquo;Cybersecurity Attacks - Red Team Strategies&amp;rdquo; is around the conceptual attack graphs in &amp;ldquo;Chapter 3, Measuring an Offensive Security Program&amp;rdquo;. Specifically, how I create them.&#xA;In this post I will briefly go over some of the reasons for creating them, and also how I create them and share a template for others to use and adjust.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m not a graphic designer, so I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are better ways of doing this.</description>

      <description>Announcement After countless evenings and weekends in coffee shops, and multiple vacations with the laptop, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce that my first book has been published. It took 18 months from writing the first words (at Victrola Coffee Roasters on Capitol Hill by the way) to finishing this project just a few days ago.&#xA;Looking back its amazing how this all came together. The first intial draft had 100 pages, and in the end it ended up being 524 pages.</description>

      <description>MITRE just updated the ATT&amp;amp;CK Framework to include Cloud TTPs.&#xA;The update includes techniques for stealing cookies from machines and using them for lateral movement. These are the two techniques I helped contribute to the matrix:&#xA;Credential Access - Steal Web Session Cookie Lateral Movement - Web Session Cookie It was exciting experience to collaborate with MITRE and contribute on this. And kinda cool to see the Pass the Cookie work referenced.</description>

      <description>No one should beat your security team on the homefield! For several years I have been using the term Homefield Advantage in the context of running a security program, especially in regards to certain aspects of red teaming. Homefield Advantage describes well what a mature security program has to realize and leverage.&#xA;Wikipedia describes &amp;ldquo;home advantage&amp;rdquo; in team sports and highlights some of the benefits:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This benefit has been attributed to psychological effects supporting fans have on the competitors or referees; to psychological or physiological advantages of playing near home in familiar situations; to the disadvantages away teams suffer from changing time zones or climates, or from the rigors of travel; and, in some sports, to specific rules that favor the home team directly or indirectly.</description>

      <title>BashSpray - Simple Password Spray Bash Script</title>

      <description>One thing every red team should attempt early on and regularly is to perform some password spray testing across their organization to identify and help remediate usage of weak passwords.&#xA;In the past I have done this on Windows a lot, but now I built a simple version for it for Bash to run it also from a Mac.&#xA;Check it out: Bash Spray&#xA;Ideally, a script like bashspray.sh is integrated into your response pipelines, and SOC, Blue Team as well as account owner get notified - so they change their password right away, and any SOC investigation can be performed if necessary.</description>

      <description>Interacting with Active Directory on the Mac Did you ever have to interact with Active Directory on a MAC?&#xA;If yes, this post might be interesting for you. I am pretty new to the Mac and basic things I know how to do on Windows need some research to figure out. This time around I explore Active Directory/LDAP Server interactions.&#xA;First, there is the Directory Utility on MacOS which can be quite useful.</description>

      <description>KoiPhish is a simple yet beautiful relay proxy idea.&#xA;The idea for this little project goes back many years. Since I started learning Golang I figured it would be good exercise to finally go ahead an implement it. So, last December during the 35C3 (which is always inspiring congress) I wrote it up.&#xA;It relays requests a client makes to the KoiPish to the actual target and responses are sent back to the client.</description>

      <description>Just a list of useful notes when dealing with Macs. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty new to Macs and there might be other, better solutions to the challenges I had to sovle but these worked for me and I&amp;rsquo;m learning. :)&#xA;Pivoting between accounts and keychain issues After pivoting on a target host and elevating to root it seems not possible to gain access to other keychains easily. It requires to know the password of the other account still.</description>

      <title>Pass the Cookie and Pivot to the Clouds</title>

      <description>Web Applications and Services use cookies to authenticate sessions and users. An adversary can pivot from a compromised host to Web Applications and Internet Services by stealing authentication cookies from browsers and related processes. At the same time this technique bypasses most multi-factor authentication protocols.&#xA;The reason for this is that the final authentication token that the attacker steals is issued after all factors have been validated. Many users persist cookies that are valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used.</description>
