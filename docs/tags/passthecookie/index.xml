      <description>Previously I talked about remotely debugging Chrome, and we also covered the latest Microsoft Edge browser along the way.
These features allow an adversary to gain access to authentication tokens and cookies. See MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK Technique T1539: Steal Web Session Cookie as well for this.
What about Firefox? For a while I was wondering if (my favorite) browser Firefox has such debugging features as well, and how one could detect malware trying to exploit it.</description>

      <description>Revisiting Cookie Crimes In 2018 @mangopdf described &amp;ldquo;Cookie Crimes&amp;rdquo;, which is great research around Chrome&amp;rsquo;s remote debugging feature that allows adversaries and malware to gain access to cookies quite convienently during post-exploitation.
The original research is published here, and it still works today.
The new Microsoft Edge browser and Chromium Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s latest Edge browser is based on the same code, Chromium. I guess, you already know where this is going now&amp;hellip;</description>
