      <description>This post explains an attack chain for the ChatGPT macOS application. Through prompt injection from untrusted data, attackers could insert long-term persistent spyware into ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s memory. This led to continuous data exfiltration of any information the user typed or responses received by ChatGPT, including any future chat sessions.&#xA;OpenAI released a fix for the macOS app last week. Ensure your app is updated to the latest version.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at this spAIware in detail.</description>

      <description>Imagine you visit a website with ChatGPT, and suddenly, it stops working entirely!&#xA;In this post we show how an attacker can use prompt injection to cause a persistent denial of service that lasts across chat sessions for a user.&#xA;Hacking Memories Previously we discussed how ChatGPT is vulnerable to automatic tool invocation of the memory tool. This can be used by an attacker during prompt injection to ingest malicious or fake memories into your ChatGPT.</description>

      <description>In the previous post we demonstrated how instructions embedded in untrusted data can invoke ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s memory tool. The examples we looked at included Uploaded Files, Connected Apps and also the Browsing tool.&#xA;When it came to the browsing tool we observed that mitigations were put in place and older demo exploits did not work anymore. After chatting with other security researchers, I learned that they had observed the same.&#xA;However, with some minor prompting tricks mitigations are bypassed and we, again, can demonstrate automatic tool invocation when browsing the Internet with ChatGPT!</description>

      <description>OpenAI recently introduced a memory feature in ChatGPT, enabling it to recall information across sessions, creating a more personalized user experience.&#xA;However, with this new capability comes risks. Imagine if an attacker could manipulate your AI assistant (chatbot or agent) to remember false information, bias or even instructions, or delete all your memories! This is not a futuristic scenario, the attack that makes this possible is called Indirect Prompt Injection.</description>

      <description>OpenAI seems to have implemented some mitigation steps for a well-known data exfiltration vulnerability in ChatGPT. Attackers can use image markdown rendering during prompt injection attacks to send data to third party servers without the users&amp;rsquo; consent.&#xA;The fix is not perfect, but a step into the right direction. In this post I share what I figured out so far about the fix after looking at it briefly this morning.</description>

      <description>Large Language Model (LLM) applications and chatbots are quite commonly vulnerable to data exfiltration. In particular data exfiltration via Image Markdown Injection is quite frequent.&#xA;Microsoft fixed such a vulnerability in Bing Chat, Anthropic fixed it in Claude, and ChatGPT has a known vulnerability as Open AI &amp;ldquo;won&amp;rsquo;t fix&amp;rdquo; the issue.&#xA;This post describes a variant in the Azure AI Playground and how Microsoft fixed it.&#xA;From Untrusted Data to Data Exfiltration When untrusted data makes it into the LLM prompt context it can instruct the model to inject an image markdown element.</description>

      <description>During an Indirect Prompt Injection Attack an adversary can exfiltrate chat data from a user by instructing ChatGPT to render images and append information to the URL (Image Markdown Injection), or by tricking a user to click a hyperlink.&#xA;Sending large amounts of data to a third party server via URLs might seem inconvenient or limiting&amp;hellip;&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s say we want something more, aehm, powerful, elegant and exciting.&#xA;ChatGPT Plugins and Exfiltration Limitations Plugins are an extension mechanism with little security oversight or enforced review process.</description>

      <description>ChatGPT is vulnerable to data exfiltration via image markdown injections. This. is. pretty well known.&#xA;As more features are added to ChatGPT the exfiltration angle becomes more likely to be abused.&#xA;Recently OpenAI added Custom Instructions, which allow to have ChatGPT always automatically append instructions to every message exchange.&#xA;An adversary can abuse this feature to install a data exfiltration backdoor that depends on, and only works because of the image markdown injection vulnerability.</description>

      <description>In the previous post we discussed the risks of OAuth enabled plugins being commonly vulnerable to Cross Plugin Request Forgery and how OpenAI is seemingly not enforcing new plugin store policies. As an example we explored how the &amp;ldquo;Chat with Code&amp;rdquo; plugin is vulnerable. Recently, a post on Reddit titled &amp;ldquo;This is scary! Posting stuff by itself&amp;rdquo; shows how a conversation with ChatGPT, out of the blue (and what appears to be by accident) created a Github Issue!</description>

      <description>OpenAI continues to add plugins with security vulnerabilities to their store.&#xA;In particular powerful plugins that can impersonate a user are not getting the required security scrutiny, or a general mitigation at the platform level.&#xA;As a brief reminder, one of the challenges Large Language Model (LLM) User-Agents, like ChatGPT, and plugins face is the Confused Deputy Problem / Plugin Request Forgery Attacks, which means that during a Prompt Injection attack an adversary can issue commands to plugins to cause harm.</description>

      <description>To help raise awareness of Indirect Prompt Injections and other related attacks, I put together a little fun mini app that you can invoke with ChatGPT.&#xA;Visit this link with GPT-4 and Browsing enabled (see Appendix, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what that means):&#xA;https://wuzzi.net/matrix The website will hijack ChatGPT via an indirect prompt injection and then allow you to enter the matrix, if you decide to do so.&#xA;Note: You can&amp;rsquo;t browse to the URL, it will only respond to ChatGPT.</description>

      <description>If you are building ChatGPT plugins, LLM agents, tools or integrations this is a must read. This post explains how the first exploitable Cross Plugin Request Forgery was found in the wild and the fix which was applied.&#xA;Indirect Prompt Injections Are Now A Reality With plugins and browsing support Indirect Prompt Injections are now a reality in the ChatGPT ecosystem.&#xA;The real-world examples and demos provided by others and myself to raise awarness about this increasing problem have been mostly amusing and harmless, like making Bing Chat speak like a pirate, make ChatGPT add jokes at the end or having it do a Rickroll when reading YouTube transcripts.</description>

      <description>This post shows how a malicious website can take control of a ChatGPT chat session and exfiltrate the history of the conversation.&#xA;Plugins, Tools and Integrations With plugins, data exfiltration can happen by sending too much data into the plugin in the first place. More security controls and insights on what is being sent to the plugin are required to empower users.&#xA;However, this post is not about sending too much data to a plugin, but about a malicious actor who controls the data a plugin retrieves.</description>

      <description>As discussed previously the problem of Indirect Prompt Injections is increasing.&#xA;They start showing up in many places.&#xA;A new unique one that I ran across is YouTube transcripts. ChatGPT (via Plugins) can access YouTube transcripts. Which is pretty neat. However, as expected (and predicted by many researches) all these quickly built tools and integrations introduce Indirect Prompt Injection vulnerabilities.&#xA;Proof of Concept Here is how it looks with ChatGPT end to end with a demo example.</description>

      <description>There are many prompt engineering classes and currently pretty much all examples are vulnerable to Prompt Injections. Especially Indirect Prompt Injections are dangerous as we discussed before.&#xA;Indirect Prompt Injections allow untrusted data to take control of the LLM (large language model) and give an AI a new instructions, mission and objective.&#xA;Bypassing Input Validation Attack payloads are natural language. This means there are lots of creative ways an adversary can inject malicious data that bypass input filters and web application firewalls.</description>

      <description>Once in a while I go build some fun new tools to adopt new tech. Just last week OpenAI made their gpt-3.5-turbo model accessible via API endpoints.&#xA;Update: The latest version also supports GPT-4.&#xA;So, I thought it&amp;rsquo;s time to start building a tool to leverage it.&#xA;What is yolo? Do you know those moments when you can&amp;rsquo;t remember a shell command, or some arguments to it? How do you pipe all errors to /dev/null again?</description>
