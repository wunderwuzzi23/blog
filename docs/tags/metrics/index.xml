      <description>Security metrics are an interesting topic.&#xA;Over the years I used &amp;ldquo;scores&amp;rdquo; as a tool to identify and shine light on problematic areas or highlight lack of engineering and security quality of certain teams.&#xA;A security score should not seen as an objective or absoulte measure, but it allows to compare systems with each other at a relative scale, and by sharing the score it makes people ask questions.&#xA;I have seen showing management ask vivid questions when they see a chart with their service and a score next to it:</description>

      <title>Red Teaming and Monte Carlo Simulations</title>

      <description>Monte Carlo simulations can be a useful tool to uplevel your red teaming skills and provide a different and fresh perspective for highlighting, discussing and presenting findings.&#xA;Red teaming is about challenging an organization. This includes analyzing business processes and methodologies, including our own.&#xA;Obviously, using Monte Carlo simulations in the security realm is not my idea. I first ran across the idea in Hubbard&amp;rsquo;s book about measuring cybersecurity risk. Since then I have been thinking and playing around with applying these methods to security program&amp;rsquo;s, especially red teaming and threat modeling.</description>

      <title>Phishing metrics - what to track?</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/phishing-stats/</link>

      <description>The results of phishing campaigns are often not comparable with each other over time. Various security vendors and red teams use different tooling and techniques - which is totally fine.&#xA;However, I recommend requiring tracking a minimum set of metrics to be able to compare results over time.&#xA;Funny side facts: At times employees are messing with the red team, entering invalid creds for CISO or CEO and things along those lines.</description>
