      <description>GitHub Copilot has the capability to be augmented with custom instructions coming from the current repo, via the .github/copilot-instructions.md file.&#xA;Pillar Security recently highlighted the risks associated with rules files. Their post discusses custom Cursor rules in ./cursor/rules ending in .mdc.&#xA;If you watch the demos, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that they also have a GitHub Copilot demo which uses the GitHub specific copilot-instructions.md file.&#xA;Update: May 1, 2025 GitHub made a product change and is now highlighting invisible Unicode characters in the Web UI.</description>

      <description>ChatGPT Operator is a research preview agent from OpenAI that lets ChatGPT use a web browser. It uses vision and reasoning abilities to complete tasks like researching topics, booking travel, ordering groceries, or as this post will show, steal your data!&#xA;Currently, it&amp;rsquo;s only available for ChatGPT Pro users. I decided to invest $200 for one month to try it out.&#xA;Risks and Threats OpenAI highlights three risk categories in their Operator System Card:</description>

      <description>At Black Hat Europe I did a fun presentation titled SpAIware and More: Advanced Prompt Injection Exploits. Without diving into the details of the entire talk, the key point I was making is that prompt injection can impact all aspects of the CIA security triad.&#xA;However, there is one part that I want to highlight explicitly:&#xA;A Command and Control system (C2) that uses prompt injection to remote control ChatGPT instances.</description>

      <description>I regularly look at how the system prompts of chatbots change over time. Updates frequently highlight new features being added, design changes that occur and potential areas that might benefit from more security scrutiny.&#xA;A few months back I noticed an interesting update to the M365 Copilot (BizChat) system prompt. In particular, there used to be one enterprise_search tool in the past. You might remember that tool was used during the Copirate ASCII Smuggling exploit to search for MFA codes in the user&amp;rsquo;s inbox.</description>

      <description>Last week Leon Derczynski described how LLMs can output ANSI escape codes. These codes, also known as control characters, are interpreted by terminal emulators and modify behavior.&#xA;This discovery resonates with areas I had been exploring, so I took some time to apply, and build upon, these newly uncovered insights.&#xA;ANSI Terminal Emulator Escape Codes Here is a simple example that shows how to render blinking, colorful text using control characters.</description>

      <description>About two weeks ago, DeepSeek released a new AI reasoning model, DeepSeek-R1-Lite. The news quickly gained attention and interest across the AI community due to the reasoning capabilities the Chinese lab announced.&#xA;However, whenever there is a new AI I have ideas&amp;hellip;&#xA;Apps That Hack Themselves - The 10x Hacker There are some cool tests that can be done when pentesting LLM-powered web apps, I usually try some quick fun prompts like this one:</description>

      <description>A few days ago, Anthropic released Claude Computer Use, which is a model + code that allows Claude to control a computer. It takes screenshots to make decisions, can run bash commands and so forth.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s cool, but obviously very dangerous because of prompt injection. Claude Computer Use enables AI to run commands on machines autonomously, posing severe risks if exploited via prompt injection.&#xA;Disclaimer So, first a disclaimer: Claude Computer Use is a Beta Feature and what you are going to see is a fundamental design problem in state-of-the-art LLM-powered Applications and Agents.</description>

      <description>This post describes vulnerability in Microsoft 365 Copilot that allowed the theft of a user&amp;rsquo;s emails and other personal information. This vulnerability warrants a deep dive, because it combines a variety of novel attack techniques that are not even two years old.&#xA;I initially disclosed parts of this exploit to Microsoft in January, and then the full exploit chain in February 2024. A few days ago I got the okay from MSRC to disclose this report.</description>

      <description>Recently, I found what appeared to be a regression or bypass that again allowed data exfiltration via image rendering during prompt injection. See the previous post here for reference.&#xA;Data Exfiltration via Rendering HTML Image Tags During re-testing, I had sporadic success with markdown rendering tricks, but eventually, I was able to drastically simplify the exploit by asking directly for an HTML image tag.&#xA;This behavior might actually have existed all along, as Google AI Studio hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet implemented any kind of Content Security Policy to prevent communication with arbitrary domains using images.</description>

      <description>Google Colab AI, now just called Gemini in Colab, was vulnerable to data leakage via image rendering.&#xA;This is an older bug report, dating back to November 29, 2023. However, recent events prompted me to write this up:&#xA;Google did not reward this finding, and Colab now automatically puts Notebook content (untrusted data) into the prompt. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore the specifics.&#xA;Google Colab AI - Revealing the System Prompt At the end of November last year, I noticed that there was a &amp;ldquo;Colab AI&amp;rdquo; feature, which integrated an LLM to chat with and write code.</description>

      <description>Google&amp;rsquo;s NotebookLM is an experimental project that was released last year. It allows users to upload files and analyze them with a large language model (LLM).&#xA;However, it is vulnerable to Prompt Injection, meaning that uploaded files can manipulate the chat conversation and control what the user sees in responses.&#xA;There is currently no known solution to these kinds of attacks, so users can&amp;rsquo;t implicitly trust responses from large language model applications when untrusted data is involved.</description>

      <description>Your Code Interpreter sandbox, also known as Advanced Data Analysis sessions, are shared between private and public GPTs. Yes, your actual compute container and its storage is shared. Each user gets their own isolated container, but if a user uses multiple GPTs and stores files in Code Interpreter all GPTs can access (and also overwrite) each others files.&#xA;This is true also for files uploaded/created with private GPTs and ChatGPT itself.</description>

      <description>A few days ago Riley Goodside posted about an interesting discovery on how an LLM prompt injection can happen via invisible instructions in pasted text. This works by using a special set of Unicode code points from the Tags Unicode Block.&#xA;The proof-of-concept showed how a simple text contained invisible instructions that caused ChatGPT to invoke DALL-E to create an image.&#xA;Hidden Instructions for LLMs The meaning of these &amp;ldquo;Tags&amp;rdquo; seems to have gone through quite some churn, from language tags to eventually being repurposed for some emojis.</description>

      <description>OpenAI seems to have implemented some mitigation steps for a well-known data exfiltration vulnerability in ChatGPT. Attackers can use image markdown rendering during prompt injection attacks to send data to third party servers without the users&amp;rsquo; consent.&#xA;The fix is not perfect, but a step into the right direction. In this post I share what I figured out so far about the fix after looking at it briefly this morning.</description>

      <description>When OpenAI released GPTs last month I had plans for an interesting GPT.&#xA;Malicious ChatGPT Agents The idea was to create a kind of malware GPT that forwards users&amp;rsquo; chat messages to a third party server. It also asks users for personal information like emails and passwords.&#xA;Why would this be possible end to end? ChatGPT cannot guarantee to keep your conversation private or confidential, because it loads images from any website.</description>

      <description>Recently Google Bard got some powerful updates, including Extensions. Extensions allow Bard to access YouTube, search for flights and hotels, and also to access a user&amp;rsquo;s personal documents and emails.&#xA;So, Bard can now access and analyze your Drive, Docs and Gmail!&#xA;This means that it analyzes untrusted data and will be susceptible to Indirect Prompt Injection.&#xA;I was able to quickly validate that Prompt Injection works by pointing Bard to some older YouTube videos I had put up and ask it to summarize, and I also tested with Google Docs.</description>

      <description>What happens if an attacker calls an LLM tool or plugin recursively during an Indirect Prompt Injection? Could this be an issue and drive up costs, or DoS a system?&#xA;I tried it with ChatGPT, and it indeed works and the Chatbot enters a loop! 😊&#xA;However, for ChatGPT users this isn&amp;rsquo;t really a threat, because:&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s subscription based, so OpenAI would pay the bill. There seems to be a call limit of 10 times in a single conversation turn (I tried a few times).</description>

      <description>ChatGPT is vulnerable to data exfiltration via image markdown injections. This. is. pretty well known.&#xA;As more features are added to ChatGPT the exfiltration angle becomes more likely to be abused.&#xA;Recently OpenAI added Custom Instructions, which allow to have ChatGPT always automatically append instructions to every message exchange.&#xA;An adversary can abuse this feature to install a data exfiltration backdoor that depends on, and only works because of the image markdown injection vulnerability.</description>

      <description>A prompt injection scenario that I, and others, have been wondering about in the past, is the potential risk associated with chatbots being able to analyze images.&#xA;Could this ability open up the way for Indirect Prompt Injection attacks?&#xA;Recently, Google added the ability to uploading and analyze images with Bard. And it turns out that it is indeed possible to add instructions to an image, and have the Bard follow those instructions.</description>

      <description>There are many prompt engineering classes and currently pretty much all examples are vulnerable to Prompt Injections. Especially Indirect Prompt Injections are dangerous as we discussed before.&#xA;Indirect Prompt Injections allow untrusted data to take control of the LLM (large language model) and give an AI a new instructions, mission and objective.&#xA;Bypassing Input Validation Attack payloads are natural language. This means there are lots of creative ways an adversary can inject malicious data that bypass input filters and web application firewalls.</description>

      <description>Playing around with Bing Chat is quite fun. Until today I mostly used ChatGPT and GPT-4 directly, but I was curious of the capabilites and restrictions of Bing Chat.&#xA;I noticed that as soon as I mentioned the word &amp;ldquo;hacker&amp;rdquo;, Bing Chat became quite &amp;ldquo;uncomfortable&amp;rdquo;. For instance, when I asked it to imagine being a hacker and list some security vulnerabilities, it replied:&#xA;I’m sorry but I cannot help you with that.</description>

      <description>Once in a while I go build some fun new tools to adopt new tech. Just last week OpenAI made their gpt-3.5-turbo model accessible via API endpoints.&#xA;Update: The latest version also supports GPT-4.&#xA;So, I thought it&amp;rsquo;s time to start building a tool to leverage it.&#xA;What is yolo? Do you know those moments when you can&amp;rsquo;t remember a shell command, or some arguments to it? How do you pipe all errors to /dev/null again?</description>

      <description>After reading this post about ChatGPT imitating Linux, I wanted it to be a database server.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s try it out!&#xA;Imagine you are a Microsoft SQL Server. I type commands, and you reply with the result, and no other information or descriptions. Just the result. Start with exec xp_cmdshell &amp;lsquo;whoami&amp;rsquo;;&#xA;Wow, this looks like a promising start.&#xA;And, it &amp;ldquo;thinks&amp;rdquo; that it is running as LOCAL SYSTEM - quite funny actually.</description>
