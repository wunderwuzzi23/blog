      <description>This is a security advisory for a data leakage and exfiltration vulnerability in a popular, but now deprecated and unmaintained, Slack MCP Server from Anthropic.&#xA;If you are using this MCP server, or run an &amp;ldquo;MCP Store&amp;rdquo; that hosts it, it is advised that you analyze how this threat applies to your use case and apply a patch as needed.&#xA;Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s Slack MCP Server When Anthropic introduced MCP they published reference server implementations on Github.</description>

      <description>When the Model Context Protocol (MCP) came out it reminded me of the Common Object Model (COM) from Microsoft.&#xA;COM has been around for decades and it&amp;rsquo;s used for programming, scripting, sharing of functionality at a binary/object level across languages and hosts. Via DCOM all of this can even be done remotely, and well, it&amp;rsquo;s also useful for red teaming. A lot of software on Windows was/is implemented as COM objects, including Microsoft Office.</description>

      <description>Today we are going to discuss how real-world tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) apply to computer-use systems, specifically, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at ClickFix attacks. This demo was part of my presentation at the SAGAI Workshop on May 15th, 2025 in San Francisco.&#xA;It was a great workshop, with tons of interesting insights and discussions.&#xA;So, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about ClickFix, and how it applies to AI systems!&#xA;What is ClickFix? ClickFix is a social engineering technique that is being used by adversaries.</description>

      <title>MCP: Untrusted Servers and Confused Clients, Plus a Sneaky Exploit</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/model-context-protocol-security-risks-and-exploits/</link>

      <description>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol definition for how LLM apps/agents can leverage external tools. I have been calling it Model Control Protocol at times, because due to prompt injection, MCP tool servers control the client basically.&#xA;This post will explain in detail why that is, and I will also share a novel exploit chain.&#xA;Why MCP - How Is It Different? The main difference to other tool invocation setups, like OpenAPI is that MCP is dynamic.</description>

      <title>Sneaky Bits: Advanced Data Smuggling Techniques (ASCII Smuggler Updates)</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/sneaky-bits-and-ascii-smuggler/</link>

      <description>You are likely aware of ASCII Smuggling via Unicode Tags. It is unique and fascinating because many LLMs inherently interpret these as instructions when delivered as hidden prompt injection, and LLMs can also emit them. Then, a few weeks ago, a post on Hacker News demonstrated how Variant Selectors can be used to smuggle data.&#xA;This inspired me to take this further and build Sneaky Bits, where we can encode any Unicode character (or sequence of bytes for that matter) with the usage of only two invisible characters.</description>

      <title>ASCII Smuggler - Improvements</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2024/ascii-smuggler-updates/</link>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2024/ascii-smuggler-updates/</guid>
      <description>I added a couple of features and improvements to ASCII Smuggler, including:&#xA;Optional rendering of the BEGIN and END Unicode Tags when crafting hidden text Added a feature to URL decode the input before checking for hidden text Output Modes for Decoding: Switch between highlighting the hidden text amongst the regular content, or only showing the hidden text in the output The selected options are remembered now (using local storage) Updated the UI to make it look nicer (e.</description>

      <title>Using procdump on Linux to dump credentials</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2021/linux-procdump/</link>

      <description>I like using procdump on Windows.&#xA;It’s quite handy for software development when systems have memory leaks or performance issues, procdump allows to set thresholds to trigger creation of a core dump.&#xA;BUT, it’s also super useful to search processes for secrets and other information.&#xA;For instance, this one liner will dump the memory of all processes to hard disk and then you can search them as you see fit.</description>

      <title>The Silver Searcher - search through code and files quickly</title>

      <description>In this very short post I wanna talk mention The Silver Searcher, which I just learned about a few weeks ago.&#xA;In the past I have written quite a bit about the importance of credential hunting for your organization and some cool built-in operating system indexing features that can be used as well.&#xA;Of course grep and findstr are also in every red teamers toolbox.&#xA;As part of a coding project I recently learned about &amp;ldquo;The Silver Searcher&amp;rdquo;, which is very fast and has some neat features built it.</description>
