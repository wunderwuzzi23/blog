      <description>Excited to announce that I will be presenting at BSides Singapore this year.
The topic is adversarial usage of virtual machines during lateral movement. And we will also cover threat hunting and detection ideas.
I have been referring to this technique as the Shadowbunny over the years. :)
The conferences is on September 24th-25th, it will be all virtual and free to attend. Check out the BSidesSG 2020 website and schedule for other talks and details.</description>

      <title>Firefox - Debugger Client for Cookie Access</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/firefox-cookie-debug-client/</link>

      <description>Finally I got to writing some basic tooling for invoking the Firefox debugging API to send commands to the browser and read the responses. This can be useful for grabbing cookies in the post-exploitation phase.
It works for Windows and macOS, should also work on Linux.

This technique is probably most useful when we don&amp;rsquo;t have root or the user&amp;rsquo;s credentials to decrypt cookies or can&amp;rsquo;t attach a regular debugger to the browser process.</description>

      <title>Remotely debugging Firefox instances</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/cookies-on-firefox/</link>

      <description>Previously I talked about remotely debugging Chrome, and we also covered the latest Microsoft Edge browser along the way.
These features allow an adversary to gain access to authentication tokens and cookies. See MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK Technique T1539: Steal Web Session Cookie as well for this.
What about Firefox? For a while I was wondering if (my favorite) browser Firefox has such debugging features as well, and how one could detect malware trying to exploit it.</description>

      <title>Shadowbunny article published in the PenTest Magazine</title>

      <description>The Shadowbunny TTP in the PenTest Magazine The latest edition of the PenTest Magazine features an article of mine about using virtual machines (VMs) during lateral movement to establish persistence and evade detections.
A few years back when I came up with the idea of using VMs for lateral movement during red teaming, I called it the Shadowbunny TTP and that name stuck around in my head. There is more info in the article around the origin of the name also.</description>

      <title>Cookie Crimes and the new Microsoft Edge Browser</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/cookie-crimes-on-mirosoft-edge/</link>

      <description>Revisiting Cookie Crimes In 2018 @mangopdf described &amp;ldquo;Cookie Crimes&amp;rdquo;, which is great research around Chrome&amp;rsquo;s remote debugging feature that allows adversaries and malware to gain access to cookies quite convienently during post-exploitation.
The original research is published here, and it still works today.
The new Microsoft Edge browser and Chromium Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s latest Edge browser is based on the same code, Chromium. I guess, you already know where this is going now&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Post-Exploitation: Abusing Chrome&#39;s debugging feature to observe and control browsing sessions remotely</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/chrome-spy-remote-control/</link>

      <description>Chrome&amp;rsquo;s remote debugging feature enables malware post-exploitation to gain access to cookies. Root privileges are not required. This is a pretty well-known and commonly used adversarial technique - at least since 2018 when Cookie Crimes was released.
However, remote debugging also allows observing user activities and sensitive personal information (aka spying on users) and controlling the browser from a remote computer.
Below screenshot shows a simulated attacker controlling the victim&amp;rsquo;s browser and navigating to chrome://settings to inspect information:</description>

      <title>Pass the Cookie and Pivot to the Clouds</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/passthecookie/</link>

      <description>Web Applications and Services use cookies to authenticate sessions and users. An adversary can pivot from a compromised host to Web Applications and Internet Services by stealing authentication cookies from browsers and related processes. At the same time this technique bypasses most multi-factor authentication protocols.
The reason for this is that the final authentication token that the attacker steals is issued after all factors have been validated. Many users persist cookies that are valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used.</description>
