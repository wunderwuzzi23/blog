      <description>No one should beat your security team on the homefield! For several years I have been using the term Homefield Advantage in the context of running a security program, especially in regards to certain aspects of red teaming. Homefield Advantage describes well what a mature security program has to realize and leverage.&#xA;Wikipedia describes &amp;ldquo;home advantage&amp;rdquo; in team sports and highlights some of the benefits:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This benefit has been attributed to psychological effects supporting fans have on the competitors or referees; to psychological or physiological advantages of playing near home in familiar situations; to the disadvantages away teams suffer from changing time zones or climates, or from the rigors of travel; and, in some sports, to specific rules that favor the home team directly or indirectly.</description>
