      <description>Monte Carlo simulations can be a useful tool to uplevel your red teaming skills and provide a different and fresh perspective for highlighting, discussing and presenting findings.
Red teaming is about challenging an organization. This includes analyzing business processes and methodologies, including our own.
Obviously, using Monte Carlo simulations in the security realm is not my idea. I first ran across the idea in Hubbard&amp;rsquo;s book about measuring cybersecurity risk. Since then I have been thinking and playing around with applying these methods to security program&amp;rsquo;s, especially red teaming and threat modeling.</description>
