      <description>Monte Carlo simulations can be a useful tool to uplevel your red teaming skills and provide a different and fresh perspective for highlighting, discussing and presenting findings.&#xA;Red teaming is about challenging an organization. This includes analyzing business processes and methodologies, including our own.&#xA;Obviously, using Monte Carlo simulations in the security realm is not my idea. I first ran across the idea in Hubbard&amp;rsquo;s book about measuring cybersecurity risk. Since then I have been thinking and playing around with applying these methods to security program&amp;rsquo;s, especially red teaming and threat modeling.</description>
