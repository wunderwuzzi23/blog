      <title>Video Tutorial: Hijacking SSH Agent</title>

      <description>Recently I got the feedback to create more tutorials and videos, and I thought SSH Agent Hijacking on Linux and macOS (which I wrote about before here) would make a good one.&#xA;The video tutorial is here.&#xA;If you like this kind of content, then comment or like the video on YouTube and I&amp;rsquo;ll create more.&#xA;Hope it&amp;rsquo;s useful to get a good basic understanding of this TTP, and help build detections for it.</description>

      <title>Ropci deep-dive for Azure hackers</title>

      <description>Misconfigurations with MFA setups are not uncommon when using AAD, especially when federated setups or Pass Through Authentication is configured I have seen MFA bypass opportunities in multiple production tenants.&#xA;A common misconfiguration is that MFA is enforced at the federated identity provider, but AAD is forgotten and ROPC authentication still succeeds against AAD.&#xA;To learn more about ROPC, check out the previous post about the topic.&#xA;This post focuses on the ropci features that can be leveraged post-exploitation.</description>

      <description>Great news!&#xA;An article about ropci is in the latest free issue of the Pentest Magazine!&#xA;The article has a lot more info then my ropci blog post or the info on the ropci Github repo.&#xA;Get your copy and check it out! It also has an article about Nuclei, one of my favorite tools.&#xA;Cheers.&#xA;Link: https://pentestmag.com/product/pentest-open-source-pentesting-toolkit</description>

      <title>ROPC - So, you think you have MFA?</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2022/ropci-so-you-think-you-have-mfa-azure-ad/</link>

      <description>This post will highlight a pattern I have seen across multiple production Microsoft Azure Active Directory tenants which led to MFA bypasses using ROPC.&#xA;The key take-away: Always enforce MFA! Sounds easy, but there are often misconfigurations and unexpected exceptions. So, test your own AAD tenant for ROPC based MFA bypass opportunities.&#xA;Github: https://github.com/wunderwuzzi23/ropci&#xA;Update: The latest free issue of Pentest Magazine has a ropci article. Check it out.&#xA;What is ROPC?</description>

      <title>TTP Diaries: SSH Agent Hijacking</title>

      <description>There are some neat TTPs that I don&amp;rsquo;t use frequently, and if the time arises, I need to dig up details again. So, I figured to write some of them down, starting with SSH Agent Hijacking.&#xA;What is SSH Agent Hijacking? Short story, if you have keys added to an SSH Agent an adversary with root permissions can use them. If you forward the SSH Agent to another host, an adversary with root permission on that other host can exploit and leverage your keys as well.</description>

      <guid>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2022/python-package-manager-install-and-download-vulnerability/</guid>
      <description>This week I learned about a design flaw with pip download, which allows an adversary to run arbitrary code.&#xA;I assumed that running pip install means anything could happen, but pip download seems a bit surprising.&#xA;Both seem useful for red teaming though.&#xA;Background This post from Yehuda Gelb named Automatic Execution of Code Upon Package Download on Python Package Manager which the Security Now! podcast pointed me towards.&#xA;The post highlights that just running pip download can compromise your computer.</description>

      <description>This post is part of a series about Offensive BPF. Click the &amp;ldquo;ebpf&amp;rdquo; tag to see all related posts.&#xA;It has been a while that we posted something in the &amp;ldquo;Offensive BPF&amp;rdquo; series. But recently there have been a couple of new cool ebpf based tools, such as TripleCross, boopkit and pamspy.&#xA;So, I thought it be quite fitting to do another post in the Offensive BPF series to keep raising awareness.</description>

      <description>Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) on Unix based systems are useful to change logon behavior and enforce authentication via various means.&#xA;In &amp;ldquo;Red Team Strategies&amp;rdquo; the chapter &amp;ldquo;Protecting the Pentester&amp;rdquo; walks the reader through the configuration of a PAM module to get notified in real-time via a pop-up when someone logs on to the machine (e.g. system compromise).&#xA;But there are also bad things that can be done with PAM (especially post-exploitation) and this is what this post is about.</description>

      <description>As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words.&#xA;In order to improve your documentation and uplevel red team and pentest reporting, it&amp;rsquo;s useful to add date and time information to screenshots and script logs.&#xA;This helps the Blue Team (and yourself) reviewing past activity, reports and when deconflicting activity is required. Depending on the shell that is used there are different ways to go about it. Let&amp;rsquo;s cover three common ones.</description>

      <description>Information for red teaming macOS and info on real world TTPs are still a bit sparse. That makes it difficult for defenders to know what attackers do on macOS compared to Windows. Some organizations might have a bigger blind spot when it comes to macOS.&#xA;This post describes how an adversary can grab hashes from a macOS machine, how to convert it to a hashcat friendly format and use hashcat to crack it.</description>

      <description>One area that I have encountered quite often over the years is that during recon phase of a bug bounty hunt or pentest a set of AWS access keys are being discovered.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s say you found 50 AWS access keys by drooling and hunting through public Github repos and using other nifty tricks and means.&#xA;How do you go about checking their validity? And what do they have access to and provide the Bug Bounty Program or Blue Team the dates, times, and IP address when those keys were used?</description>

      <description>Although Gitlab is not as popular as Github, it’s common to run across it these days. Especially after Microsoft acquired Github it seemed more individuals and organizations flocked over to Gitlab.&#xA;In this post I want to document a couple of recon commands that are useful post-exploitation, and for blue teamers to watch out for.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s assume one has access to a Gitlab Token as a precursor. Let&amp;rsquo;s walk through some interesting commands and script snippets to leverage to find out more.</description>

      <description>The last weeks of 2021 got quite interesting for security professionals and software engineers.&#xA;Apache&amp;rsquo;s log4j library and its now prominent Java Naming and Directory Interface support, which enables easy remote code execution, made the news across the industry.&#xA;What makes Log4Shell scary is the widespread adoption of the Log4j library amongst Java applications, and the ease of remote exploitation.&#xA;A dangerous combination.&#xA;Patches got released, bypasses were discovered more patches were released and so forth.</description>

      <description>Tabnabbing is a web application security vulnerability that can be used to perform phishing attacks, so its important to be aware of it as a developer and penetration tester.&#xA;It is easy to mitigate and in this short video we cover both attacks and mitigations.&#xA;Thanks for reading and happy hacking!&#xA;@wunderwuzzi23</description>

      <description>Over the last few years eBPF has gained a lot of traction in the Linux community and beyond.&#xA;eBPF&amp;rsquo;s offensive usage is also slowly getting more attention. So, I decided to dive into the topic from a red teaming point of view to learn about it to raise awareness and share the journey.&#xA;Similar to the format of my Machine Learning Attack Series, there will be a serious of posts around BPF usage in offensive settings, and also how its misuse can be detected.</description>

      <description>In this 25 minute video I&amp;rsquo;m explaining the foundations of Web Application Security.&#xA;The video covers the basic building blocks of web applications, such as HTML, HTTP, JavaScript and Cookies. Furthermore core web applications security concepts such as the Same-Origin Policy are discussed in detail.&#xA;The goal is to provide foundational knowledge to help grasp security vulnerabilities, such as XSS, CSRF, SQLi, tab-nabbing, etc. later on.&#xA;In the past I have trained and presented content like this to thousands of engineers at large organizations and cloud providers, hence its quite optimized for best learning and comprehension outcome.</description>
