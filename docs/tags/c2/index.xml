      <description>A few years back the Blue Team of a company asked to be targeted in a Red Team Operation.&#xA;That was a really fun, because Rules of Engagement commonly prevent targeting Blue Teams. Blue&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, systems and team members are often out of scope, unfortunately.&#xA;Blue team infrastructure is a gold mine for credentials, recon but also for remote code execution!&#xA;Often companies do not have adequate protection, procedures (MFA, multi-person attestation), monitoring and auditing in place when it comes to accessing data from endpoint agents.</description>
