      <description>Misconfigurations with MFA setups are not uncommon when using AAD, especially when federated setups or Pass Through Authentication is configured I have seen MFA bypass opportunities in multiple production tenants.&#xA;A common misconfiguration is that MFA is enforced at the federated identity provider, but AAD is forgotten and ROPC authentication still succeeds against AAD.&#xA;To learn more about ROPC, check out the previous post about the topic.&#xA;This post focuses on the ropci features that can be leveraged post-exploitation.</description>

      <title>ROPC - So, you think you have MFA?</title>

      <description>This post will highlight a pattern I have seen across multiple production Microsoft Azure Active Directory tenants which led to MFA bypasses using ROPC.&#xA;The key take-away: Always enforce MFA! Sounds easy, but there are often misconfigurations and unexpected exceptions. So, test your own AAD tenant for ROPC based MFA bypass opportunities.&#xA;Github: https://github.com/wunderwuzzi23/ropci&#xA;Update: The latest free issue of Pentest Magazine has a ropci article. Check it out.&#xA;What is ROPC?</description>

      <title>gospray - Simple LDAP bind-based password spray tool</title>

      <description>On a network and need credentials? Try password spraying the domain controller directly.&#xA;A few years ago, I wrote this password spray tool called gospray that was used succesfully in a couple of engagements since. It does an LDAP bind directly against the domain controller to validate credentials. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t require an SMB server (or other servers) as target. So, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty quiet and number of concurrent Go routines is configurable.</description>

      <title>BashSpray - Simple Password Spray Bash Script</title>

      <description>One thing every red team should attempt early on and regularly is to perform some password spray testing across their organization to identify and help remediate usage of weak passwords.&#xA;In the past I have done this on Windows a lot, but now I built a simple version for it for Bash to run it also from a Mac.&#xA;Check it out: Bash Spray&#xA;Ideally, a script like bashspray.sh is integrated into your response pipelines, and SOC, Blue Team as well as account owner get notified - so they change their password right away, and any SOC investigation can be performed if necessary.</description>

      <title>Active Directory and MacOS</title>

      <description>Interacting with Active Directory on the Mac Did you ever have to interact with Active Directory on a MAC?&#xA;If yes, this post might be interesting for you. I am pretty new to the Mac and basic things I know how to do on Windows need some research to figure out. This time around I explore Active Directory/LDAP Server interactions.&#xA;First, there is the Directory Utility on MacOS which can be quite useful.</description>

      <title>Lyrebird - Hack the hacker (and take a picture)</title>
      <link>https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/lyrebird/</link>

      <description>The idea for Lyrebird came from observing that sometimes when someone forgets lock their workstation, someone else might mess with their computer. Since I wanted to learn more on how to program a webcam and take pictures - I figured why not create a little tool that takes a screenshot and uses the webcam to take pictures of anyone that interacts with the computer while I&amp;rsquo;m gone.&#xA;The way this work is simple, start Lyrebird.</description>
